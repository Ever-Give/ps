Chapter 5

When the three of them got back to class, David saw that the two girls had moved their desks back to where they had been originally. Or perhaps the teacher had moved them when her three students had been out of the classroom. David didn't want to disrupt the class any further by trying to find a new seat, so he sat at the same desk as before, and the two girls did as well. Once the three of them were seated, the teacher went on with the course overview as though nothing unusual had happened. If David looked closely, he could tell that the teacher was still mildly irritated about the interruption, but she was hiding it well and David felt confident that she wouldn't mention the incident to him again.

Stacy and Christine continued to lightly caress David's thighs throughout the rest of the class, but that was all they did. David found it much easier to follow what the teacher was saying, although he did often find his mind drifting back to what the two girls had done to him and to each other.

And what they might do in the future.

Once this class was over, David thought, he should probably avoid these two girls at all costs. Sure, they were hot and playful and frisky, but man, they could sting like psychological hornets. But then he looked from one of them to the other and saw the dreamy smiles on their faces. Surely it was worth sacrificing some short-term comfort and dignity to make two girls smile like that?

Besides, to be completely fair, it was their «sting» that had attracted him to them in the first place. Now that he was thinking about it in a more relaxed frame of mind, it seemed reasonable that he should have to pay his dues if he wanted to watch them squirm at each other's mercy.

When the class ended and the three of them starting putting their stuff away, Stacy said to Christine, «You know, I think I like the idea of expanding our horizons.»

«You're the one who started it,» Christine pointed out.

«Only by accident. You've since taken it in a direction I would never have thought of. David, who else gets off the school bus at your stop?»

David, who had just finished zipping up his backpack, had to think about this. «Jenny and ... Lizzie,» he said finally. «I think that's what they call each other. I myself have never spoken with either of them.»

Stacy looked at Christine and said, «I think it's high time we started making some new friends.» She turned to David and said «We'll see you at the bus,» before swinging her backpack over her shoulder, getting up, and following Christine (who had done the same) out of the classroom. By the time David had donned his own backpack and gotten to his feet, the two girls were both out of sight.

Neither Christine nor Stacy was in David's fourth period class. However, David's experiences with them that day had been so intense that he spent pretty well all of fourth period savoring and recovering from those experiences, sparing a minimal amount of attention for the teacher's explanation of grading schemes and the summary of material that would be covered that semester. The occasional flirty looks that David got from his fourth period classmates (looks that were completely superficial but would ordinarily have made him feel warm inside) he ignored entirely; he simply did not have room in his mind to think about the peers surrounding him at that moment.

By the end of fourth period, however, David's mind had relaxed. As he went to his locker to get his jacket, he thought about the computer games he would be able to play when he got home since he didn't have any homework that afternoon. He also wondered what interesting dreams he might have that night.

As he was waiting for his school bus to arrive at the school, David noticed Stacy holding two disposable coffee cups. As he walked toward her, he heard her ask someone else, «Do you want some hot chocolate?» before handing the two cups to two other girls who were also waiting for their bus. Stacy then turned to look at David.

«How come they get hot chocolate?» David asked resentfully. Even though he had technically only met Stacy that day, he felt slighted that she would give something to someone else but not to him.

«Oh, do you want some?» Stacy asked. She seemed a bit surprised, but her composure barely wavered, and she had a pleasant smile on her face.

No, not pleasant. Amused. Hungry.

David would have facepalmed if he hadn't been worried about ruining the surprise.

Instead, he put on a smile of his own. «Actually, I think I'm okay,» he said, hoping that Stacy could tell that his resentment was now gone entirely. «Thanks, though.» He kissed her left cheek and said more quietly, «I do appreciate it.»

Stacy kept smiling but said nothing.

When David pulled away he saw that his bus had arrived, and that students were starting to board through the open front door. He was not surprised to see the two hot chocolate recipients heading toward that same bus, and he followed them as closely as he could without shoving aside anyone else trying to board that bus. He was able to get on the bus and to the aisle before the girls he was following got to their seats, and when they did sit down, both in the same two-person seat, David took the empty seat across the aisle from them. He scooted over to sit by the window and looked out; he didn't want the girls across the aisle to catch him looking at them while it was still convenient for them to move.

David felt someone start climbing on top of him, and he looked to see that it was Christine. Stacy was right behind her and took the aisle seat next to David while Christine positioned herself on David's lap. «What are doing?» David asked.

«You didn't think we would let you have this show all to yourself, did you?» Christine asked.

«Is it common for you to randomly sit on people's laps?» David asked, taken aback.

«Only when they take my take my spot,» Christine answered with a playful smile.

That was fair.

The anticipation of what was to come, and the knowledge that it would only last for a limited period of time, was making David's stomach feel tight and his mouth start to dry up. He looked out the window, licked his lips, and tried to keep his mouth closed. He had to open it, though, in order to take some slow, deep breaths to try to relax himself. Even doing that, it was difficult to calm down, particularly with the girl sitting on top of him, but David was able to find some measure of peace by the time the bus started pulling away from the school.

Once the bus was moving, David turned from the window to look past Stacy to the two girls across the aisle sipping their hot chocolate. The sips were very small at first, but by the fourth sip they started to get more substantial. Presumably, the hot chocolate was starting to cool enough that it wouldn't burn the tongue. More to the point, though, the clock had started ticking. David resumed looking out the window. There wouldn't be much to see for awhile, and he didn't want to get caught staring.

Morally, David should have warned the two girls across the aisle not to drink the hot chocolate. The surprise that he would have ruined would not be an entirely pleasant one for those being surprised. But it was meant as a joke; there was no real malice, only an extreme sort of playfulness. There was a fine line between the two, certainly, but David could tell when that line was crossed, and he had not yet seen either Christine or Stacy cross it, even when he had been their target. And, of course, David was looking forward to the show too much to have been willing to nip it in the bud.

David heard a female voice ask, «Why are you sitting on his lap?» He turned to see the two girls across the aisle looking at him and his two new friends.

«Because he's cute,» Christine answered, wiggling her bum against David. «You like that, don't you?» she asked David, moving around some more without taking her weight off of him.

«Are you seriously giving a lap dance on a school bus?» one of the girls across the aisle asked Christine incredulously.

«Totally,» Christine responded.

«Okay, whatever,» the girl across the aisle said, chuckling. To Stacy, she said, «Thanks for the hot chocolate. It's really good.»

«Yeah, thanks!» the girl next to her said enthusiastically.

«You're welcome,» Stacy said, smiling.

The girls across the aisle went back to drinking their hot chocolate. By the angles they were raising their cups, and the length of time they were holding them there, they appeared to be finishing up the last of it.

Christine ground her bum against David some more. «We've got them,» she said quietly into his ear. «They don't know it yet, but we've got them. Both of them. We'll be seeing a really great show in �» she turned to Stacy and raised her voice a notch � «how much longer, Stacy?»

Stacy looked at her watch. «Twelve minutes,» she said.

«Twelve minutes,» Christine repeated quietly into David's ear. «In twelve minutes we'll get to see some delicious panicking.» She said the last two words very slowly.

David's mouth was watering.

The wait was difficult at first. David tried to pass the time by looking out the window, but he found himself looking back across the aisle every few seconds to see if anything had changed. The girls had stowed their (presumably empty) hot chocolate cups somewhere so that they wouldn't have to hold them, but other than that David's frequent glances didn't reveal much. Christine helped the time to pass a bit more quickly by continuing to intermittently grind into David's lap. Eventually David was able to look out the window for longer and started to zone out.

Then David heard Stacy say, «Hey.» He looked to see her addressing the girls across the aisle. She was giggling, and Christine was starting to giggle as well. «We put a special powder in the hot chocolate I gave you,» Stacy said. «It's a trick we call «watersucker'. You should be feeling the powder's effects in about �» she looked at her watch � «five seconds. Four, three, two, one �»

� and then Stacy and Christine both called out, «Watersucker!»

Just as they said this, each of the girls across the aisle, predicably, suddenly grabbed her crotch tightly with both hands and exclaimed, «Oh my god, I have to pee so bad!» Stacy and Christine double-high-fived each other and both started laughing triumphantly.

«Yup, that's what the powder does,» Stacy said, still laughing. «Until today, Christine and I have only used it on each other, but now we're realizing how much fun we can have by watersuckering new people. I bet you're really uncomfortable right now. I bet you feel like you're about to start pissing helplessly into your pants right here on the school bus.»

«This isn't funny!» one of the girls across the aisle yelled. They were both squeezing their vulvas repeatedly with their hands. «I really, really have to pee!»

«So do I!» the girl next to her said.

«That's what makes it funny!» Christine said. She was also still laughing. «Watching you both freak out and squeeze your pussies tightly, desperately trying not to pee all over yourselves right here in public, is one of the most beautiful things I can imagine. I'm pretty sure David here loves it, too.» She pressed her bum against David again, moving from side to side as she did.

David was starting to feel lightheaded.

The girls across the aisle both crossed their legs and started rocking back and forth and tensing their thighs in phase with the hands still squeezing their vulvas. Christine and Stacy started laughing harder.

«It's getting worse, isn't it?» Stacy asked her victims. «You have to pee so-o-o bad, but the bus isn't at your stop yet, and you're trying so-o-o hard to hold it, but you don't know how much longer you can. I hope you live close to the bus stop and don't have to walk too far with your full bladders, hunched over, taking tiny steps, and gripping your pussies as tightly as you possibly can, terrified that at any moment the pee might start shooting out of those pussies and make a huge mark on your pants while you're out there on the sidewalk. Assuming you can even make it off the bus dry.»

«You know, watersuckering two people at the same time was a good idea,» Christine said to Stacy. «The way it hit them both at the same time made for an even bigger impact than we're used to.»

«I know, right?» Stacy said. «Oh,» she added, looking out the window, «this is our stop.»

Christine looked out the window as the bus slowed down. «So it is,» she said.

«We'll see you tomorrow,» Stacy said to the girls across the aisle, who did not appear to be in a condition to pay much attention. «We should be able to have a more meaningful conversation then. Of course, we'd love to stay and watch you for longer right now, but we need to get off here. Try not to piss yourselves.» To David, she said, «I know you're enjoying the show, but do keep an eye out for your bus stop. You'll probably spot it more easily than they will.» She nodded toward the girls across the aisle.

The bus stopped. Stacy, still laughing, got up and tickled the nearest of the two desperate girls, saying, «You really do have to pee amazingly badly, don't you?» While she did this, Christine ground into David one last time. Then Christine got up as well, and she and Stacy started walking toward the front of the bus. David continued to watch the two frantically squirming girls across the aisle. They glared at him briefly, but then they had to return their attention to their own bodies.

As the bus started moving again, David found that the desperation was slightly less exciting without Stacy and Christine there to laugh and tease. But only slightly. He still got a great amount of enjoyment watching the two girls try to use their entire bodies to put pressure on their overworked vulvas, doing everything they could to keep from wetting themselves. They continued to squeeze rhythmically with their hands and crossed thighs, and to rock back and forth. It was quite a show. By the time David was able to tear his attention away, the bus was slowing down again and he realized that it was reaching his stop. «This is our stop,» he said to the girls across the aisle as he started to put on his backpack.

«Huh?» the nearer of the two girls asked.

«You get off the bus here, right?» David said.

The girl looked out the window. «Right,» she said uncertainly. She removed one hand from her crotch to pick up her backpack. The other girl did not appear to have noticed either of them, though.

When the bus stopped, David got up, walked to the aisle, and said to the desperate girl sitting next to the window, «You get off the bus here too, right?» She looked at David, confused, then she, also, looked out the window, appeared to understand in a distant sort of way, and also removed a hand from her crotch to pick up her backpack.

The aisle girl had, by this time, managed to stand, although she was bent over slightly and still had one hand frantically squeezing her vulva (her other hand was holding her backpack). David started walking toward the door to the bus so that he wouldn't be in their way. When he got to the door, he looked back to see that both girls were some distance behind him in the aisle and moving very slowly. Since he wasn't actually friends with either of them, he decided it would be weird to be seen to wait for them, so he got off the bus and started walking toward his house. He walked a bit more slowly than he might have otherwise, and he frequently looked over his shoulder to see if the girls had gotten off the bus yet.

He was halfway down the block when the girls did, eventually, emerge from the bus. He stopped to watch them; they were not facing him, so they probably wouldn't notice him. He saw one of them point across the street, and then they both crossed in front of the school bus. Once they were across, the school bus pulled away. David then saw the girls both drop their backpacks onto the sidewalk across the street from him so that they could again hold their crotches with both hands. They would frequently raise one leg, bending it sharply at the knee, and cross it over the other.

Then they both went between two parked cars next to the sidewalk and, with great effort, and still pee pee dancing furiously, managed to unfasten their pants and get them and their underwear down to their knees. They then quickly squatted down between those same two parked cars and David immediately saw a powerful stream of pee coming down from under their bare thighs. David stared at them openmouthed. They were peeing, outside, in a suburban area, hidden only by two cars, their bare bums exposed to the air. David was not, by any means, offended by this, but it was something he did not get to see very often.

He spent a few moments taking in the tableau before him: two girls, squatting between a pair of parked cars, their legs bare from knee to waist, peeing on the asphalt. He tried to store it in his mind. He didn't want the girls to catch him staring, though, so once he thought he had the image memorized, he turned and continued to walk home.

Forget computer games. What David needed was a nap.
