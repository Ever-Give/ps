David wasn't really expecting Christine and Stacy to join him for lunch, but he sat in a quiet section of one of the long tables anyway because he wanted to be able to savour what he had seen without being distracted by unrelated conversations. He was still startled that Christine has spoken to him, considering that she hadn't even looked at him since the incident the previous semester. He hadn't even introduced himself, hadn't uttered more than a meaningless monosyllable to her, and yet she had behaved as though there was a bond between her and David. Perhaps he could chalk it up to her playfulness, although that playfulness only seemed to be manifest on rare occasions. Maybe that was the nature of playfulness.

As he ate his lunch, David wondered when, if ever, he might next see the two girls do something interesting. He now shared a class with them as well as a bus, but remembering the previous semester and Christine's comment about the school bus being "too obvious", he imagined that they would likely spend the rest of this semester mechanically taking notes and doing classwork, talking only to answer the teacher's questions and to pull their weight in group assignments; in other words, they would be even more boring than the other students in the class. David's thoughts became more abstract as he imagined that all people in the world had the same amount of "fun" in them, and that they could either distribute this fun evenly over time or concentrate it in occasional intense pinpricks of fun and spend the rest of their time as soulless robots.

"Is it okay if we sit next to you?" David heard a female voice ask from behind him.

"Sure," David said offhandedly. While he did not want anyone to distract him from his thoughts, it would have been rude to deny someone a place to sit when he had six empty spaces to his left and to his right on both sides of the table.

David felt two bodies slide down his sides and then squeeze up against him as tightly as they could. "There's lots of space," he said.

"Are we making you uncomfortable?" the girl on his left asked in a flirty voice. He turned to look at her and was startled to realize that she was none other than the blonde girl, Stacy, who ten minutes ago had been frantically bouncing her legs and squeezing her vulva trying not to pee in her pants, and probably devoting any remaining brainpower to getting back at her companion, Christine � although, from what David had observed, it had been Stacy herself who had started it, whatever "it" was. At the moment, however, Stacy was smiling pleasantly. Was there a hint of mischief in her eyes? Regardless, David was amazed at how quickly her attitude had changed. Not having to pee anymore helped, he supposed, but still ...

"I'm Stacy," Stacy said, extending her right hand. David knew this already, but the formality of introductions was important.

"David," David said, shaking Stacy's hand.

"Christine," the girl to David's right said. David released Stacy's hand, turned, and saw that the girl to his right was indeed the brunette who had tormented, and previously been tormented by, Stacy. She, too, was smiling (this was less of a surprise), and she, too, had extended her right hand. David shook it.

"David."

When he released her hand, Stacy spoke again. "We're sisters."

"Twins," Christine added.

"Fraternal twins," Stacy clarified. "Although we're both pretty hot." She reached over and pinched Christine's left nipple. Christine squealed.

And David had been worried that they would never do anything interesting again.

"So," Stacy went on, "did you enjoy the show last period?"

This from the victim? Was David in trouble?

"It's okay," Christine put in. "I'm sure you enjoyed the show last semester on the bus, as well."

Stacy now spoke to Christine. "Yeah, that was pretty funny. Although, I must admit, you got me back pretty good. I mean, I hate you, obviously, but I'm still impressed." David got the impression that she was saying "I hate you" as a matter of form rather than because she was truly upset. Stacy turned her attention back to David. "It's a trick we like to play on each other," she explained. "We have this white powder that we can dissolve in each others' drinks that makes the person drinking it feel a sudden, intense need to pee about fifteen minutes later. Fifteen minutes after that, the person will no longer be able to hold it regardless of how she tries. But we don't use it so much to make each other pee as to make each other squirm and panic."

"Usually we give it to each other at home after locking and closing the bathroom door with nobody inside it," Christine added. "It's possible to unlock the door from the outside, but it's really difficult, and it's even more difficult when you're desperate to pee and your sister is standing right behind you and tickling you constantly. The pee pee dances we do outside the bathroom are hilarious. But now someone �" she looked meaningfully at Stacy � "seems to have decided that it would be funny to dish the stuff out in front of other students. Well, two can play at that game."

"It's not the first time we used it in public," Stacy said defensively. "Christine put some in my water bottle when we were out hiking, miles from any bathrooms or buildings of any kind. I ended up having to pull down my pants, squat, and pee outside."

"That wasn't the first time, either," Christine retorted. "Stacy gave me some while we were enjoying what would otherwise have a relaxing float downstream in a canoe. The riverbanks were too steep to come ashore anywhere in the area, and I didn't want to stink up the canoe by peeing in it, and I was afraid I would tip the canoe over if I tried to squat over the edge, and I didn't want to get my clothes wet, so I stripped naked, jumped in the river, and peed there.

But then Stacy wouldn't slow the canoe down enough for me to get back in, so I had to walk and swim behind her until she finally found a place to come ashore, at which point she took my clothes, which were still in the canoe, and ran off into the forest with them. I waited in the canoe, completely naked, for like fifteen minutes before Stacy finally came back, and she didn't even have my clothes with her anymore! She said that she had hidden them in the forest, and that if I wanted them I would have to find them. Well, at that point I just pushed her down into the canoe, sat on her, and bopped her on the head with the side of my fist over and over again until she agreed to bring me my clothes back."

There was silence among the three of them for a few moments. Then Stacy said, in an impressed tone, "Wow. I had forgotten about that. Okay, that one is a winner." Composing herself, she said to David, "Anyway, tickling and teasing each other when we're frantically trying not to pee in our pants is really fun. But the most delicious part is when we tell the victim what we've done just before she starts feeling the effects of the powder. We like to tell her concisely, since the blow would be dulled if it came in the form of a lengthy explanation, so we came up with the word 'watersucker': water as a euphemism for urine, and sucker because the victim didn't see it coming. We try to say this word within thirty seconds of the first fifteen-minute mark, and let me tell you, the look of horror on the victim's face when she realizes that she's about to have to pee extremely badly with no bathroom available is priceless."

"I bet," David said breathlessly.

"How about that?" Stacy said to Christine. "He can talk."

"So he can," Christine responded. To David, she said, "Could I see your schedule?"

"Sure," David said, taking his schedule out of his pocket and unfolding it.

Looking at the schedule, Christine said, "Stacy, look at this. We're all in the same class right after lunch."

Stacy looked at the schedule. "Cool!" she said, excited. "Let's all sit together in it." She put her right arm around David and squeezed. "David's one of us now."
