Hi everyone: I'm new to this forum, so forgive me if the following content is not right for it, or if you become bored with it because it is, admittedly, too long. But it is a story- one I wrote a while ago, true - I have written many - and a quick way for me to make an introduction. I also have some personal experiences to share, which I will try to do, with time. thank you for your patience...

Lord, but he is magnificent!

Millicent allows her eyes a fleeting second of appreciation. Though knowing this man for his reputation, she cannot but admire: the noble forehead, the breadth of his shoulders, his belly, flat and muscular even in repose. And yes, she must admit to her darker self, thighs to which she might so easily succumb! She must be blushing: she is blushing! He notices - oh heavens!

«Warm fire, aint it?» He says. «Are ye fond of chequers, ma'am?»

«Very warm.» She acknowledges: «Er�.why do you ask, sir?»

«Because it's your move, and has been for ten minutes?»

She regards the chequers board, trying to discern a play. «Aye me,» She says, «I had quite forgot! I was lost in your conversation, Gerald. There, will that do?»

«It will splendidly, for me! So, ye're a keen huntswoman, eh?»

Millicent vaguely recalls that the talk had, indeed, been of the day in the field. But miasma brought on by the heat of the fire, the very symphony of this man's presence, the growing awareness of her own inner needs have hopelessly distracted her. She glances across to her sister, dutiful chaperone, who sits at needlework, for assistance. Anna comprehends. She mouths the words «Tobias - was - blooded» and makes a small cross with her forefinger.

«Why yes.» Millicent glances back at her sister, then pointedly at the bracket clock on the far wall. «A fine day for young Toby, was it not?»

«The lad distinguished himself, it is true.»

Anna takes Millicent's meaning perfectly. This is, after all, exactly what they have planned, these two mischievous women. Gerald Rosythe, bachelor at large, whose eligibility as the best catch in Berkshire is not to be questioned, is, they agree, possibly also the most widely travelled, most romantically experienced, most pompous bore they have ever encountered. He must be humbled. And Millicent A'barth, herself a renowned beauty, is ideally suited to the task.

Anna coughs discreetly, then gives a heavy sigh. «Dear sister: I fear the hour has overtaken me. I confess I can barely stay awake. Will you excuse me, Mr. Rosythe?»

She makes to leave.

«Why ma'am!» Gerald rises, sweeping his coat-tails into place. «I shall also, of course, bid you goodnight.» And he looks down upon the fair Milly as he takes her hand: «Though not without regret.»

Millicent gazes up into the Nordic blue of his eyes from the deep pools of her own:

«Then, Gerald, will you not stay a little while longer? Talk with me some more, I beg you?»

The noble Rosythe returns her stare with a reckless glint of his own. «But Ma'am, you are unchaperoned. Your reputation?»

«Oh, fie to my reputation! Come sir, we are both people of the world. My sister will swear she did not depart until the midnight hour.»

«Twelve of the clock.» Affirms Anna. «Not a minute earlier.»

«You see?» Millicent pouts with dark, moist lips which speak of wicked matters: «You would quite offend me by leaving our game unfinished.»

Rosythe's posture betrays his unease; but the woman before him is just that: a woman, not some chaff of a girl whose eager mother predates upon indelicacies of this kind. And she is beautiful: so very, very beautiful. He smiles his good grace.

«You have quite disarmed me. Of course, if you wish it, I shall stay.»

«I bid you both goodnight, then.» Says Anna, repairing to leave. She has, however, noticed the hard lines at the corner of her sister's eyes, and knowing Milly she asks quickly. «If you are quite well, my dear? Would you wish me to tarry while you fetch your medicine?»

Millicent is dismissive. «No, no. I will be perfectly all right. Goodnight, Anna.»

«Very well.» Anna takes her needlework, moving to the door behind Rosythe. As she opens it she catches Millicent's eye and, giving her a wicked look, crosses her own eyes as she performs a quick, tight curtsey. Then she is gone.

«Medicine, ma'am?» Gerald is solicitous. «Are you ill?»

«Oh indeed no, sir!» How she loves the affectation of concern men make when they detect a weakness in the female armour. And she might, indeed, have gone to «fetch her medicine» in the code she shared with her sister, had the corridors between here and the water-closet been less long or less draughty, or had she not such hatred of the borderloo which she knows waits discreetly next door in the withdrawing room chest. Vile, infected things! Then the prospect that Connor, elderly manservant, would be able to scrutinise her water afterward. The old fool would probably spend the night sniffing at it like some mangy dog! Besides, the chemistry between herself and this man, this brute of a man, is almost palpable: she does not want to break the spell. The fire is very warm, she thinks. The pain of her discomfiture surges. She must move things along. «Please, in our new-found confidence, you must call me Milly?»

«Ah, Milly�.»

«Your move, I think?»

«Is it indeed, ma'am?...Milly.» Gerald surveys the chequers briefly, moves a piece through a sequence of takes. «There, Milly. I believe I have you, do I not?.»

«Aye, me.» Millicent acknowledges. The inference is not lost upon her. «I think you may do, soon. I shall move - so.»

She moves a piece cunningly enough. «You see, sir, I may not be so easily taken.»

He glances at the board, then looks again more carefully as he sees her trap. «Ahah! I do see. I do Milly. Yet if I then move my piece so?»

She knows well enough the man before her will not swoon like some ardent young beau at a mere glimpse of ankle - no, she must give him more meat than that. So when she lifts her daintily-slippered foot to push the game table to one side she lifts her petticoats too so he may have an inch or so of her calf, perhaps even, in the greatest shade, a fleeting picture of some thigh. «Then I must resign.» Millicent says sweetly.

Rosythe engages her eye. «I think, madam, that you care not a fig for the game.»

Millicent returns his look. «I protest that I do, sir! I care for this game very much indeed.»

«You tease me, Milly.»

She would smile playfully, were it not for the sudden spasm which grips her groin. As it is she covers the moment ably, she thinks. «Well perhaps a little, yes.» She has some witty rejoinder she must make, but in her pain she has quite forgotten it. Instead, she shifts herself slightly and says nothing.

«You are uncomfortable, Milly?»

«I? No, certainly. I am warm by this fire, and could not be more comfortable. Do you wish me not to tease you, Gerald?»

«No, I quite like it.» He is perceptive, Milly thinks. Why do I feel that he sees right through me? She is forced to make an inventory of herself and her condition: surely she could not be so short of self-control? The dinner was a heavy meal, yes, and the wine flowed freely enough, but she has never been thus incommoded before. Yet this pain has a sharpness about it which brooks no denial. She must conclude this interview soon, or it might be too late. Heaven forbid! Get a hold of yourself, Millicent!

«I believe you to be a little ill.» He says. There is a peculiar emphasis upon the word «ill». «I think that you might well prefer this evening to conclude?»

«No.» Millicent says firmly. «I will not hear of it. Are you quite determined to deprive me of the pleasure of your company? Come, talk to me of the hunt today, if you please?»

«If you wish it.» He smiles. «If you are quite certain you wish it?»

«I do.»

«So be it.»

He continues his narrative, giving details of the kill in lurid terms, praising the manliness of Tobias in the presence of so much gore. Millicent is not listening. Had she been, her sympathies might have gone to the poor beast rent in twain to give substance to these creatures' sport; for Millicent, for all that she has a strong sense of mischief, is not cruel by nature. But her ears, it has to be said, are singing to a different strain. And anyway, how coarse, how vulgar this oaf is! His turn of phrase that of the countryman, his regional drawl so annoyingly disarming! It is some while before she realises he has ceased talking. She snaps hurriedly to herself, firmly pressing herself to the chaise upon which, without knowing, she has perched herself forward over the rung, like a bird.

«Do go on, sir?»

«Why, I have finished Ma'am - Milly. I do not think you heard a word of it.»

«Nay, sir!»

«I do not. And I believe you in such discomfort now as to be unable to make cogent argument. I ask again, Milly, do you wish this interview closed?»

A purple blush rises in her cheeks. He knows me! He sees the cause of my pain! Frantically, she tries to remind herself of the trap she and Anna have intended to set: to arouse this man to helpless passion and then withdraw, just as Anna returns with her servant woman to collect the needlework she has left carelessly behind. «With his breeches around his knees!» they schemed together, giggling in the seclusion of their room. «Oh, Milly, what do you think it looks like?»

Now, there is no question that a part of Millicent's body is threatening her control - she feels giddy with the struggle: what if she should faint, and whilst unconscious, what if the unthinkable should happen? With titanic courage, she takes a firm hold upon herself, resolving to resume her charted course. Now, how may she charm him?

«Thank you no, Gerald. Although I am touched by your concern.» And she manages to bat her eyelids, vexed that a tear has formed in the corner of one of them.

«But ye are in a dangerous agony, Milly.»

«You are too pleasant with me, sir. I beg you do not. I have some mild ague, it is true, but I am well able to contain it.»

He says nothing, scrutinizing her for a moment while she, literally, squirms before his gaze. She may not be still now, no matter how hard she tries.

«Not mild, Milly.» He says. «No, not mild.»

She might admit his truth: she is almost ready to, abandoning all hope of pursuing her vile little scheme; but it is then she notices. His breeches have taken on a subtly different profile as that unseen thing, the subject of so many whispered girly boudoir conversations, forms beneath them into something large and very strong. It seems to press against the fabric at his groin, determined upon release. The size of this monster is as breathtaking as the rapidity of its growth, and it captures Millicent's attention so utterly she almost forgets herself upon the spot. Furthermore, Rosythe is quite relaxed about this development, so much so he scarcely tries to hide it, but, seeing Milly now herself staring open-mouthed he sits forward, saying with a humorous twist to his lips. «You see you undo me, Milly. I am mortified!»

«And I am - amazed.»

«You know full well what a spell you weave, minx!» He chides her. «Don't attempt to deny it!»

«I profess ignorance, Gerald. Is my - discomfiture - pleasing to you?»

«That and its inevitable result.»

«Indeed the result is not inevitable!» Such a thing! Millicent has heard of strange practices in some exotic Eastern bordellos where the harlots are said to perform certain acts for their clients; Rosythe would be apprised of such things, she is sure. But this! Never in her wildest, most aroused and erotic dreams has her masculine conquest ever demanded she� well - lose control of herself! She is blushing furiously at the prospect: «Really sir, this is just too much!»

«Nay, ma'am, not nearly enough! Say the thought does not titillate, just a little?»

Millicent is beetroot: her forehead also shines with the effort of retention, and a tiny trickle of that dew gathers to descend past the corner of her eye. «Oh, this heat is intolerable!» She cries, making to rise. «You offend me sir! I must to bed.»

«Milly, you will not make it across the room. Stay, I implore you.»

He is right. Millicent finds herself pressed upon many fronts. Indeed she cannot rise, as her half-hearted attempt has already made plain. If she does she will surely embarrass herself . There is no thought of long corridors and water-closets now: even the borderloo in the adjoining room is a bridge too far. But then there is some dreadful toll exacting itself upon her whole body, whether from the pain of denying a natural function or some other cause she does not at the moment know. Her bosom, her normally soft, yielding breasts, are as if starched. Her nipples stand too hard against the revealing silk of her low-cut gown.

And yes, how her heart pounds! How everything screams to be free! Down in the darkest regions of her body as she constantly shifts herself, pressing against the source of a growing panic, she is all too aware of her swelling cunni-lips and the strangely perverse demands they are beginning to make. Ah, how easy it would be to abandon all decency at this moment! She collects herself. She may entertain no delusion that this boor is ignorant of her position - he is most blatantly alluding to it. Can he be so arrogant, so cruel as to wish her to sit here until she misbehaves? Or can he simply not countenance such a weakness in her that anything so terrible could happen? Of course the latter must be the truth, and yet�.and yet he is so craven in his lust as to boldly exhibit his maleness in a way most unfit!

«I see we do not have long.» Rosythe's tone is at once crisp, decisive. «As you will not come to me, Milly, I shall come to you. Y'see, I have a solution for ye. A means by which your little scheme may still bear fruit.»

«Scheme, sir?» Millicent peers through the mist of her gathering tears.

«Oh, yes. Come now, m'dear, you do not imagine I have been deceived by so transparent a manoeuvre?» He has moved to sit beside her upon the Chaise Langue, and takes her hand, her hot, freely sweating hand, between his own. It is not an unkind touch. «So many fair damsels, Milly m'dear. So many wicked parlour games! Did ye think y'were the first to try and disgrace me?»

There is no more time. In horror, Millicent feels the flood gathering and knows that this time the gate will be too weak to hold it back. She gives a tiny cry. A tear escapes to trickle down her cheek. «Oh! Oh sir I think�..»

His hands are suddenly beneath her, slipping expertly through her skirts and petticoats to the heat of her flesh. He is lifting her, lying back upon the Chaise as he pulls her on top of him, and she would fight him off, or protest at least, at this outrage, had she any command of her situation left, but she has none. With nothing beneath her Millicent must now burst herself and this she does. A gush of hot piss fires from her like a musket ball. In vain she tries to restrain it, but Rosythe's hands are pressing at her waist beneath her clothes and her bladder is deflating like a balloon: there is nothing she can do.

«Aye, me!» Confident now that she will not resist him, Rosythe allows her to settle so she is straddled over him, her piss audibly cascading down onto his lap. Thus positioned, he slips his hands down to cup her buttocks, spreading them as his fingers explore the stream. He touches her; finds the essence of her pain, and, with extraordinary clarity of mind, Millicent discovers that she no longer wants to resist him: that his arrogance, his boorishness, his bluntness no longer trouble her. Her fingers seek his, feverishly plucking at the too-numerous tiny buttons of his breeches to release the monster, the enemy she must admit. When it comes to her, when its bulbous tip suddenly springs free to insist between her cunni-lips she has to cry out; whether it be for pain, or for wanting, or for no reason she can understand

«Gerald - « She realises her voice is almost a whimper. «What are we doing?»

He looks up into her eyes with what may pass for a dreaming smile: «Why, Milly, we are finishing our game.»

«You are a blackguard, sir.» She admonishes him softly.

«Aye madam. That I know.» He whispers. «And ye are a minx. Have you finished your pissing?»

«I do believe so.»

«Good. So now I may begin.»

Anna is true to her word. She and the servant-woman time her return perfectly, the door to the withdrawing room is flung wide. Yet the prospect within is not what they expect. Millicent is seated in the chair formerly occupied by Rosythe, her hands stretched to accept the warmth of the fire's dying embers. Opposite her, upon the chaise longue, the recumbent form of Gerald Rosythe is stretched out in slumber, and the servant-woman's breath draws in sharply as she sees that his breeches are wet.

Millicent presses a finger to her lips, saying softly: «It has just happened. Too much wine, I fear. I beg you, do not wake him. He will hate himself if he knows we have seen him so.»

They slip quietly from the room together, the two sisters and the servant, closing the door quietly so as not to disturb the sleeping Gerald. The music of their retreating laughter is not lost upon their quarry, however. Rosythe, smiling ruefully, rises from the sodden cushions. His humiliation will be brief: after all, such matters as inebriation and their consequences are not the stuff of salon conversation. The subject is to distasteful, too close to the edge of acceptable humour. As for the servant, well, his state might cause amusement in the servant halls for a day or two, but it is, after all, no worse than they expect from their own after the excesses of a drunken night.
