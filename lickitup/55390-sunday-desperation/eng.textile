I woke up at 8.30 this Sunday morning. Unusually for me, I didn't need to go pee straight away, I think because I got up for at a wee at 3am.

Anyway, I have a whole day of nothing in front of me. I've got a few jobs to do, but nothing major. As I'm laying here in my bed thinking about getting up and making breakfast, a wicked idea has just started for form in my head. Don't go and pee at all first thing, drink lots, and get really desperate, then pee. I wasn't sure how I was going to pee yet, or even where, but I knew it would come to me as time progressed. SO anyway, here is the diary or events as they happen.

I wrote this introduction just after Id had me breakfast, but the rest is written as it happened. I'll keep coming back and adding things to this as time goes on today. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did doing it.

8.30 Woke up and decided to have a desperation session to see how long I could last.

8.45. Got up, put my dressing gown on and went and made breakfast. Frosty's with lots of milk and a big cup of coffee.

9.00. Drank � pint of water. Then went and emptied the washing machine and hung the washing out.

9.10 Drank another � pint of water, and folded up some washing that was on the dryer. Desperation level - nothing doing yet, the water has not hit my bladder yet.

9.30 Drank another � pint of water, and watched the news on BBC.

9.50 Off to the kitchen again for another � pint of water. I think slow and steady is the order of the day. I want this to last. Desperation level - still nothing to worry about. I though it would have started to be noticeable by now, but not.

9.55 Put another load of washing into the machine. Right time to get dressed. Shave first, and brush teeth.

10.16 OK I'm dressed now. Shorts and tee shirt. I got the first wave in my bladder while brushing my teeth, nothing to worry about. It was just that first sensation of bladder filling. I had a shower too, and found that I was quite turned on and ended up having cheeky little wank. I came in my hand. Didn't realize I was going to feel so horny!

10.19 Right got to go to the recycling place to get rid of a load of old bottles. Going to have another � pint before I go. Back soon.

11.06. I'm back at home now. Got rid of the empty bottles. I also went into ASDA to get some supplies that I needed including a nice ice cold bottle of Oasis. I've not drunk it yet, but will when I've finished this entry.

Well things have progressed quite a bit now. As I was driving up to the recycling place, I got some large waves across my bladder. Must have been the seatbelt and speed bumps that did that. As I was walking round ASDA, my desperation seemed to subside a little, maybe because I was concentrating of what I needed to buy. I picked up the Oasis at the checkout. I was lucky and got to queue at, what I would consider the prettiest checkout girl in ASDA. If only she knew what I was up to.

On the way back I was getting some major pulses in my bladder. Desperation level - filling up nicely, but can still hold on.

11.27 Been copying some files about on my laptop, and putting them where the needed to go. Also drunk my Oasis. Well, things are getting worse now. It's coming in waves now, and have been bobbing up and down a bit in the chair. It seems to be getting worse quite quickly now. Desperation level is about 6 out of 10 now. I'm going to site down a have a look at the Sunday papers now to try and take my mind of it.

11.38 Well Its hitting me now. Bladder is taking control. If I push my hand down inside my shorts and press my bladder, its feels so full, very horny though.

Think I need to up the anti a bit though. Time for another � pint of water. Desperation level is now about 7 out of 10. Better start thinking about how and where I'm going to pee.

11.47 Just been out to bring the washing in off the line. My bladder is feeling quite full now. If I press it, then I can feel it pushing down at the base of my cock. Going to put another load of washing out on the line, and of course have another drink too.

11.54 Ooohhh its feeling heavy now. If I stand up, and have to bob about and my legs are starting to push together on their own. I think when I eventually go and pee. I'm going to sit down in the bath, and pee over myself. I like doing that as I can get a nice arc of pee shooting up into the air, then splashing down over me.

11.57 It's time for lunch. Going to make myself a sandwich and a coffee too.

12.05 Made my lunch, now to eat it. I had 2 more glasses of water while I was making it, and I've got my coffee to drink too. It's been a long build up, to feeling like this, but now I want to push it. While I was stood making my lunch, I was pushing my ass out a bit to increase the pressure on my bladder. It feels so good to feel the pressure, then when I relaxed my ass, the pressure eased just a little.

12.15. Well that's my lunch gone, and more importantly my coffee gone too.

I'm very desperate to pee now. I've got a constant pressure in my bladder, and it's making me twitch UN-controllably, but I don't want to pee just yet. I'm sure I can last a little longer. Seeing as though it's Sunday, I'm going to go out and wash my car, that should take my mind of the pressure.

12.26 OK so I couldn't finish washing the car. My desperation level has just hit a big 10. I'm now in pain with my full bladder. So I'm going to have to get undressed, and go and lay in the bath, and let my piss go all over me. I reckon I've only got a few mins now till I burst, but when I'm in the bath, I'm still going to try and hold for as long as possible until I actually cantt take any more.

12.42 Mission accomplished! I was actually hard getting undresses. Bending over to take my shoes off was hard work. I got into the bath and laid down. I held my cock and gently stroked it so I had a semi hard on. I could feel the massive pressure of pee in my bladder but I wanted to make it last for as long as possible. Eventually after about 2 minutes it felt like, I relaxed. At first my pee wouldn't come out because I'd been holding for so long. Then it started, slowly at first, I held my cock upright so I would have a nice arc of piss.

First of all the pee just seemed to go up about an inch and splash back down on my cock. I managed to stop, teasing myself and stroked my semi hard cock which now felt silky wet. Then the pressure got the better of me, and I let fly with piss. I had a very large arc now splashing down on me, I could feel it running over my balls and down my ass crack. I slowly changed my aim so that it splashed on my chest an eventually into my open waiting mouth. I could hear my mouth filling up with piss. I stopped he flow, and gently pushed the piss out of my mouth over my chest. Then I started to piss again, back into my mouth and over my chest.

I think because I'd drunk so much water the taste was not too strong. I moved my aim back straight up so it splashed down on my cock again, and gently rubbed it while this happened. My cock felt so slippery warm and wet, I was able to hold it firmly but my hand still was able to slip up and down the shaft with the piss as a lubricant. My spray started to slow, even though I knew that there was more pee in there to come out. I stopped stroking, and just held my cock upright but gently.

Then the stream started again, but this time not as strong. I still managed to aim some onto my mouth though. I just let it all out now, relaxed and wet. The stream was not as full as before but constant. Man there was a lot of pee in there. Eventually it began to die off, so I lay there in my own piss for a few minutes, then stood up and switched the shower on. As I was showering, I had to pee again. This must be because to let the last bit out when things had relaxed a bit more. I let the pee out over my cupped hand, then brought it up to my mouth and slurped it out of my hand. Man it tasted good.

So here I am all dressed again. Now that was a morning I will remember for a long time.
