1. Yvette

The band has just finished playing a swing song when a man in full dress appears on the stage. He says, "Now I have a surprise for you. It is a very special pantomime." Elegantly, he reaches out his hand towards the centre of the stage and shouts, "Yvette!" Then he withdraws briskly along the stage. He disappears behind a small wall at the end of the stage.

I have given myself the treat of a weekend in Paris, France. I participate in a charter tour which has on tonight's program one of the city's famous, big shows, which takes place at a central location of the city. However, my plans are different as I have instead decided to go to a smaller club known for running different types of burlesque shows. This night club lies in a different and less prestigious part of the city.

The room in which I am sitting has an oblong shape and a high ceiling. I have the impression that many years ago it was the room in a factory. From above, the stage looks like one half of the cross section of a pear. The small wall behind which the advertiser withdrew is at the end of the narrow part of the stage. I am sitting slightly to the side and at some distance from the main stage so that the narrow part of the stage and most of the main stage are on my left-hand side.

A black-haired girl dressed in white appears on the stage. The audience welcomes her by applauding. She is a young girl, not much over 20, maybe she is younger. She is not beautiful, but quite pretty. She has bangs and on either side pretty, black curls that reach her chest. Her sleeveless dress consists of a top part and a skirt. A tight corset connects the bra part of the top with the skirt. The skirt is of the wide type with several petticoats underneath. The low shoes on her feet are white.

She waves her hand to her head, pouts her lips, sighs and breaths through her mouth. It is like she says, "Oh, it is so hot!" I imagine that she is walking in a park on a warm summer day. She holds an empty glass in her right hand. She puts the glass to her lips and lifts the stem of the glass high. She sticks her tongue into the glass as far as she can as if to reach the final drops. She moves the glass away from her lips, turns it upside down and shakes it up and down to demonstrate that it is empty. She reaches the edge at the front of the main stage and turns to her right towards the narrow part of the stage. As she walks, she continues to demonstrate that the day feels hot and that the glass is empty. The hall is silent now. The audience looks at the pretty girl's movements.

Sometimes she stops and struts, puts her butt out and squeezes her thighs together. I do not quite understand why. She reaches the left end of the stage, turns and walks back along the narrow part of the stage towards the main stage. Now and then she resumes her mysterious strutting, but now she also puts one leg in front of the other. I'm beginning to suspect what it is about. She reaches the main stage and swings onto it. She walks along the stage's edge, which curves elegantly from the narrow part of the stage to the main stage and further in a semicircle around the main stage.

Suddenly, a man whispers so that everyone can hear, "Oh l� l�! Il faut faire pipi!" ("Oh! She must pee!") Then she stops, puts one leg in front of the other and presses her hand as far down on her stomach as her voluminous skirts allow. With the hand holding the glass, she points at the man who whispered. She widens her eyes and nods intensely as if she says, "Yes, you are right, Sir, I have to pee!" Then she continues walking along the edge of the stage. She walks around all of the main stage, turns and walks back. Sometimes she repeats the demonstration of her need to pee. When she comes back to the front of the main stage, she stops abruptly.

She turns slowly towards the audience while she puts the index finger of her left hand against her temple. Her face lightens up in a smile. We understand � she has gotten an idea! She puts her legs apart. She moves the glass downward and holds it in front of the lower part of her stomach. Then she bends her knees slightly and presses the glass against her wide skirt so far in between her legs that she can. Then she moves the glass out from its position in between her skirts, lifts it up to her mouth and mimics drinking.

Then she lowers the glass to in front of her chest while she smiles and nods towards the audience as if she says, "You see? I pee into the glass and drink from it to quench my thirst." There is a certain uneasiness in the audience � is she going to do it? Some people clap their hands. She nods, smiles at those who are clapping, as if she says, "It's a good idea, right?" Then she puts her legs together and starts walking along the edge of the main stage towards the narrow part of the stage. She resumes the demonstration of her sense of warmth by waving her hand to her head. Occasionally, she stops and repeats the movement of the glass down to her skirt and in between her legs and back up to her mouth. When she reaches the narrow part of the stage, she stops and turns towards the audience.

She steps quickly and repeatedly in the same place for a few seconds. We get it: Got to pee � can't wait any longer! She smiles shyly at those sitting closest while she puts her legs apart. A drum roll sounds. With a sincere look on her face, she bends forward as she stretches her arms down to the skirt's edge. She lifts her skirt a bit. She struggles with her petticoats for a few seconds until she finds the innermost one. Then she puts the glass under that petticoat and up under her crotch and holds it there. Her thighs are visible on both sides of her arm but not her crotch because her skirt covers it. There is some uneasiness in the audience. She lifts her left hand and places her index finger in front of her mouth to hush the crowd. The obedient audience calms down � she has the audience in the palm of her hand now. She lowers her eyes and concentrates. A few seconds pass.

Suddenly, she lifts her head. She lights up, nods intensely and places her thumb in the air as if she says, "Now I am peeing!" Some people in the audience start clapping. Then she lowers her eyes again. I wonder: Does she pee through her panties, or doesn't she wear any panties , or maybe she wears split crotch panties ? She stands there for quite a while, maybe a minute, maybe longer.

Then, cautiously, she lowers the glass and moves it out from under her skirt. She straightens herself up and puts her legs together. The drum roll stops. Triumphantly, she holds the glass high so that everyone can see. It is almost full and has a yellow content. There is some scattered laughter in the audience. She places a hand on her stomach and breathes a sigh through pouted lips. We understand that she feels relief after having emptied her bladder.

With a smile upon her face, she walks along the narrow part of the stage towards the main stage while she proudly keeps holding the glass high. When she reaches the front of the main stage she turns towards the audience. All sounds from the audience cease.

There is tension in the air. She wipes her forehead with the back of her hand and then waves her hand to her head. She opens her mouth and moves her tongue back and forth along her lips. It is as if she says, "Oh, it's so hot! My mouth is so dry - I am so thirsty!" Then she bends forward and grabs the glass with both hands. Slowly she lifts the glass to in front of her mouth. Tentatively, she puts the glass to her lips. Then she lifts it so that the pee reaches her lips. Does she drink? The distance from where I sit is too long to tell. Then she removes the glass from her mouth and straightens up.

She opens and closes her mouth a couple of times and licks her lips. Apparently, she tastes the pee in her mouth and on her lips, and she wonders if she is going to drink the rest of the pee in the glass. Then she puts the glass to her lips again.

This time she lifts the glass and bends her head slowly backwards. She seems to be drinking! Now she bends her head back forwards and removes the glass from her lips. She makes a face but breaks quickly out into a smile. She holds the glass up in front of her. I can see that the contents have decreased. Some people start to clap, and I join in. She moves her left hand from the glass and waves it to her head. She licks her lips as if she says, "It's so hot! Oh, it was so good to drink!"

More people start clapping. She moves her left hand back to the glass so that she again holds the glass with both hands. She smiles and appears a bit shy or unsure of herself in that she moves a little back and forth along the stage while she enjoys the increasing applause.

2. The audience

She holds the glass in front of her breast with both hands. Now she shifts the glass to one hand, lowers the glass and stretches it out to the audience. She has an inquisitive look on her face while she gazes down at the people sitting closest. It is as if she says, "Will anyone else have a drink?" She walks a little hesitantly along the edge of the stage while she keeps holding the glass out to the audience and gazing down at the people sitting closest to the stage.

Suddenly, someone in front of her lifts a hand. She stops in front of that person, who turns out to be a grey-haired, almost bald man. She puts her feet slightly apart and squats. She puts the glass down on the stage floor beside of her. Then she pulls her skirts up and puts them over her thighs against her stomach.

What is the black triangle between her legs? Is it a black panty or her pussy? The hall is silent. I believe that people are wondering the same as I. I try to spot her pussy lips inside the blackness, but the distance is too long for me to distinguish anything. If she has her panties on, its lower part must be soaked in pee now � is it a little darker down there? No, the triangle is equally black everywhere. The sides of the triangle look perhaps a little too straight to form the boundary of a bush of pussy hair. I look for panty straps from the top two corners of the triangle up through the depression between her thighs and her belly out to the sides of her hips. I see none, but maybe the straps are skin-coloured.

She picks up the glass and hands it to the old man. Cautiously, she places the edge of the glass to his lips. He sips on the glass. She lifts the glass a bit. Then he quickly raises his hand and puts it over her hand, probably to prevent pee from overflowing and running down his chin and shirt front. He drinks a bit and then he pushes the glass away from his lips. She nods in thanks and smiles approvingly at him. She stands up. She walks along the platform edge while holding the glass out towards the audience � is there anyone else who would like to drink? She reaches the narrow part of the stage and continues walking along it.

Near the stage, a woman wearing a smart trouser suit stands up and stretches out a hand. Yvette moves up to her and squats and puts again her skirt against her stomach. Yvette hands the glass over to the woman, who seizes the glass and begins to drink.

People close to Yvette begin to clap. Why? I think the reason is that Yvette does not wear panties and that people applaud to express their joy of seeing her delightful pussy.

The woman in the trouser suit has swallowed a mouthful or two of Yvette's pee when she hands the glass back to Yvette, who receives the glass. Yvette gets up again and resumes her walk along the narrow part of the stage. She reaches the left end of the stage without anyone else having signalled a desire to drink.

She holds the glass out in the direction of the musicians, who sit on a separate stage divided from the narrow part of the stage by the small wall where the advertiser withdrew. She nods invitingly towards them. She is probably joking because the distance is too long for them to be able reach the glass. The nearest of them smiles, shakes his head and raises his hand with the palm towards her in a dismissive gesture � no drinking of girlie pee here, no way!

As she turns round and resumes walking a hand shoots out from behind the small wall and grabs the glass. She stops in surprise when her arm with the hand holding the glass is being pulled in behind the wall. OK, the advertiser takes liberties! After a few seconds, she gets her hand with the glass back. She smiles as she inspects the glass � the contents has decreased. It seems that her pee has gotten popular! She lifts her head in a proud gesture and continues walking back along the narrow part of the stage. She is approaching the part of the room where I am sitting.

Should I try? I have to hurry deciding because she is going to reach the right part of the main stage in a matter of seconds! I look towards the nearest part of the stage. Are there any free seats by the edge of the stage? Yes, there! I've spotted an empty chair at a table. Spontaneously, I get up and walk quickly towards the table. When I get there, I take hold of the chair, look at those who sit around the table and say, "Excusez-moi?" Generously, one of them extends a hand towards the chair as if to say, "By all means!" I nod and say, "Merci." I lift the chair, turn it around away from the table and towards the stage and sit down in it.

Yvette walks along the edge of the main stage now. She has not yet reached the part of the platform by which I am sitting. She does not look at me but the audience on her right-hand side. Nevertheless, I suspect that she has noticed me in the corner of her eye because I have the feeling that she gravitates towards me.

Now she arrives at me. I smell her perfume. With a smile she hands the glass to me. She whispers, "Monsieur?" I say, "Merci." She squats in front of me. She puts the glass down, lifts her skirts up to her stomach. She finishes by opening her legs towards me � it is as she is inviting me to have a look. I do not hesitate and cast an excited glance at her triangle. But at the same moment the glass, which she is handing to me, blocks my field of view. The glass is a little over half full. I bend forward. Cautiously, she places the glass in touch with my lips. She raises the glass until the pee reaches my lips. I let a little pee run into my mouth. I taste it. Oh, my, this is real girlie pee! She giggles. She pouts her lips and pours carefully. Now her pee flows into my mouth. I drink and swallow it down. She laughs softly. She whispers, "C'est bon, quoi � mon pipi?" ("It's good, what � my piss?") I look into her eyes and nod slowly. She smiles with satisfaction.

I must find out whether she is wearing panties or showing her pussy! Her hand is in the way. I lift my hand and my fingers grip her arm. Her skin is so smooth � it feels as if I am touching a peach! I push her arm gently to the side while I continue drinking her pee. Now I can see in between her legs. I take an overview. First, I look at her buttocks. Then further up: The crack between the buttocks lead up to the black triangle with her white thighs sticking out on either side. Over the triangle is her soft belly. My gaze continues upwards until I see her skin disappearing under her skirts. These images of her float through my brain while her piss gurgles down my throat.

Oh my! Now I see that it really is her pussy showing between her legs! A small tuft of hair above the horizontal line of the triangle puts me on to it. She has rubbed her pussy hair in with some kind of pomade to make her pussy hair stick to her skin. The black triangle appears as a dense mat of long, black, and curly pussy hairs. In addition, she has shaved the area around her pussy so that the mat of pussy hair forms a perfect triangle. I can make out her pussy lips at the bottom of the triangle.

"Oh l� l�!" she whispers, looking with big eyes at my mouth. I look up at her face and smile � I've impressed her by my pee drinking! She smiles back in response. I have drunk most of the pee in the glass now.

Suddenly she turns the glass down so that the pee stops flowing into my mouth. Surprised, I smile insecurely and look enquiringly up at her � doesn't she want me to drink all her pee? That way she wouldn't have to drink the pee herself! She ignores my smile. Instead, she looks reproachfully at me and says, "Mais, Monsieur!" Oh, she thinks I'm too greedy for her natural champagne! Then a big, beautiful smile breaks out on her face � she is lovely! So, she had only been joking. Then she pulls the glass from my lips towards herself. I loosen my grip around her arm and let my fingers glide along her smooth skin.

She moves a little. I come to think of her pussy � must see it before it disappears! I lower my gaze from her face. Her pussy moves a little as she starts rising. It rotates from me as she bends forward and her pussy lips disappear from my view. As she rises her pussy turns towards me, and I see it in all its glory. Then her pussy disappears when her skirts slide down as she stands up straight. She leaves me and walks towards the centre of the main stage, and upon reaching it, she turns to the audience.

She raises the glass to her lips. She begins to drink. She shows no skepticism this time. She bends her head back and lifts the glass high. The audience claps. To pick up the last drops, she stretches her tongue into the glass as she did at the beginning of her pantomime. Then she takes the glass from her mouth. Triumphantly, she holds the now empty glass up in front of her.

She smiles broadly at the applauding audience. She is fidgeting in the same way that she did when she received the applause for having sipped her own pee the first time. When the applause begins to subside, she curtsies and thanks for the applause by taking her hand to her mouth, kissing it and blowing kisses to the crowd. She turns from side to side as she blows kisses towards every part of the hall. Then she waves at us, turns and moves towards the back of the stage. She moves seductively, wiggling her butt a bit. Then she disappears through an opening located on the side at the back of the main stage. The applause is ringing.

I remain, still sitting in my chair. I feel the emptiness after her. People go on clapping. The applause gets stronger as people start to clap simultaneously. An encore? The idea encourages me, and I begin to clap too � but what would she do? To my surprise, she suddenly reappears on the stage.

3. Yvette returns

She waves to the crowd. She does not bring the glass this time. She reaches the edge of the front of the main stage. She turns to her right and blows a kiss in the direction of the woman who drank her pee. Then she turns to the front and blows a kiss to the old man who is right in front. I get a little nervous � is she going to blow a kiss to me too? She turns to the area where I am sitting, and yes, now she rewards me too by blowing me a kiss. Politely, I blow a kiss back to her. Then she turns forward again.

Pouting her lips and looking amazed, she lifts her skirt to her waist. Okay, so she wants to show us her beautiful well-groomed pussy! Her hips are a bit high and narrow. She has placed one leg in front of the other. It makes her look elegant and increases the focus on her pussy. People clap in appreciation. Her face breaks out into a big smile. The girl is beautiful, and her control of the audience is an experience in itself. I come to think of the others in my charter tour company. They probably also get to see girls who expose themselves, but only girls wearing sophisticated lingerie, not girls showing their naked pussies like Yvette is doing now.

She turns to her right side towards the audience in that part of the room while she changes her legs so that the other leg is in front. People continue clapping. Then she turns towards the last third of the audience, again switching her legs. Then she turns back towards the centre of the hall. She lets her skirt fall back into place. I look at her triangle as it disappears. This is the last time I get to see her pussy, I think.

She lifts her hands to her mouth, kisses her fingers and blows kisses over the audience. Then she waves at us and laughs. She turns, and a wave of applause follows her as she moves towards the bottom of the stage where she leaves the stage as she did before.

I wake up from my fascination of her. Okay, so the show is over. In spite of my thinking, people are still clapping. Well, I cannot stay here. I feel that the people sitting around the table behind me where I borrowed the chair are staring me in the neck.

I get up, move the chair back to the table and express my gratitude for the loan of the chair. They look at me with faces with large, slightly stiff smiles. One of them holds his hands in front of his chest and claps slowly. I am aware of the fact that I, as one of the pee drinkers of the audience, am a part of the show. I nod but do not smile - I feel a little embarrassed. To get out of the somewhat awkward situation, I hurry away from them and move back towards my original seat.

When I sit down at my seat, the clapping has evolved into synchronised clapping. What is this? Is there going to be another encore? Oh, yes � there she is! Yvette is entering the stage again. She throws kisses out to the audience who welcomes her back by clapping and cheering.

She stops in the middle of the main stage and squats. She puts one hand behind her on the floor and leans against it. With her other hand, she fumbles with her skirts and pulls them up and more or less succeeds in making them lie against her belly. Her pussy comes into view. So I got to see it once again! For better support, she puts her other hand behind her too. Then she spreads her legs the best she can for everyone to see. In doing so, her pussy lips part so that the inside of her cunt can be seen as a bright patch at the bottom of her triangle.

A drum roll sounds. The hall is silent. She is concentrating. A few seconds pass. Suddenly, a stream breaks out of her pussy. Someone in the audience calls out. People start clapping. The drumming stops. Yvette smiles broadly. Then she again gets serious and concentrated. Another stream breaks out of her pussy, and this one reaches far longer on the stage floor than the first one. The audience is shouting and clapping again.

Then she moves one of her hands from the floor behind her up to the side of her head and places her index finger against her temple. Her face lights up � she has gotten another idea! By now this girl's performance has overwhelmed me. A drum roll sounds again, and the audience gets silent. She stretches her arm out in front of her stomach as far she can. She has directed the palm of her hand inward towards her stomach. A stream breaks out of her pussy. She tries to intercept the stream by rapidly moving her hand towards the stream, but she fails. Okay, so the idea is to use her hand as a target! She has closed her mouth and sucked her lips into her mouth. She tries again. She moves her hand to the position about where the pee stream just passed. Another stream breaks out. This time the stream hits her hand. The drum roll stops and the audience claps encouragingly.

She shakes the pee off of her hand and lifts her hand to her face. She opens her mouth and puts her hand into it and sucks her fingers. Her eyes are wide open. It looks as if she is trying to find out what to think about the taste of her own pee. The crowd is clapping enthusiastically. It strikes me that this audience is rather strange until I realise that I am clapping frantically myself. She moves her hand down in front of herself again. The concentrated look on her face reappears. She pees and the pee shot hits the target again. Once more she shakes her hand, moves it to her face, puts all her fingers into her mouth, and sucks them. This time, however, she smiles and nods her head in acknowledgement of the "exquisite" taste of her own pee. Some laugh and others sigh, probably longing for a taste, too. She continues her "hit the target" show until her pee stream gets too weak to reach her hand.

She gets up. She lifts her shoulders, stretches her arms out to the sides, makes large eyes and her mouth wide as if she says, "Sorry, empty!" People clap, and Yvette smiles. Then she waves a final goodbye to us, turns around and leaves the stage.

The clapping fades. The band begins to play a swing number. A man with a bucket in his hand appears on the scene and quickly cleans up after her.

I wonder what I should do next. Wait for the next act perhaps? No, I find that Yvettte's pantomime show has been so remarkable that I choose to leave - I do not want to get other impressions that might weaken the experience that her show has given me. I get up promptly and leave the room. I walk up a flight of stairs to the wardrobe. I ask the attendant for my clothes. I hear behind my back, "Let me introduce The three jugglers!" It is the advertiser shouting down in the hall.

While I am waiting for my coat, I notice a stack of magazines on the counter. I take a look at the magazine on top and see that it is the night club's program. One of the pictures on the cover is of Yvette. Well, there is no point in buying the program now that I am about to leave. My attention shifts to the wardrobe attendant as he returns and lays my clothes on the counter. I pay the wardrobe charge and put on my clothes. When I am about to leave, I get an impulse. Why not buy the program and keep it as a memory of Yvette? I think it is a good idea. I pay the 20 euro that the program costs and put the magazine into the inner pocket of my coat and hurry back to my hotel
