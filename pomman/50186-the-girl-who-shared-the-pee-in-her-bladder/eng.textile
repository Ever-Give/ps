1. IN THE WAGON

"Oh, I'm gonna piss my panties soon," thought Simza. She was sitting with her legs crossed and with her hand pressed hard against her pussy. The gypsy wagon she sat in was winding its way up a valley. "Around the next turn," Jacob had said with a chuckle when she asked him to stop. It must have been a hundred turns back.

He was always that way, she thought. He didn't care and showed no respect. She must have developed a pee bladder the size of a football! She had given up looking for the pot. It probably was somewhere under all the clutter in the wagon. It was certainly not where it should be.

She and Jacob had decided to leave at a moment's notice. They had not yet had time to tidy up all the things they had loaded into the wagon. She had tried to make herself a comfortable place to sit by using some bags of clothing. She was alone in this part of the wagon.

She rose to improve her sitting position. She shook the bags she had been sitting on. She concentrated on her pussy. She didn't want pee to squirt into her underpants! Then she stuck her butt out, put one leg in front of the other, pressed a hand on her pussy and sat down again.

Despite the unpleasant situation she was in, she smiled when she came to think of something that had happened when she was a little gypsy girl. One day one of the big girls, Donka, who used to walk around with a cocksure smile on her lips, had come up to her. She had taken both her &#8203;&#8203;hands in hers, looked into her eyes and said, "Dear Simza, there is something you need to know." 'Fookin', she thought, surely, that was what it was about.

She was finally going to learn what the word meant! Her friends had teased her because she was the only one who did not know it. She had realised that there was something special about this word, but all she knew about 'fookin' was that 'fookin mad' meant 'very angry'. However, what she had heard Donka say was, "There are many things a girl needs to know in this world and one of them is the taste of her own piss." She had gotten amazed. Why did she have to know that? Had Mirela � the prettiest and tallest girl among her friends, the one she admired the most � also been told to taste her own pee? She had not understood, but had thought that Donka, who was such a big girl, almost grown-up, had to know because she knew everything, didn't she?

Then Donka had continued by telling her how she was going to do it: She had to drink her own pee all day every day when there was a full moon. She should form her hand into a scoop, pee it full, lift it up to her mouth, lower her lips into the pee, suck it all up, rinse her mouth with it, and swallow the pee. Then she should open her mouth again to allow air to fill it so as to make the pee taste as strongly as possible.

She had done what Donka had said. She had called the 'full moon' days for 'full bladder' days. This was because on these days she had held her pee back in order to drink pee as few times as possible during the day. She had not told anyone about it because she felt it would be embarrassing.

She had noticed that some boys looked more at her than usual on her 'full bladder' days. She had smiled at them and thought, "They like pee desperate girls!" One of them had stood out by being the boy who looked most at her this way, and he became her first boyfriend.

However, he had had one requirement to become her boyfriend. I want a girl with a pussy with a real pussy smell, he had said. Although she had felt a bit tense, she had let him check by sticking his hand behind her skirt waistband into her knickers, pulling his finger through her &#8203;&#8203;pussy crack and smelling his finger afterwards. However, she was relieved when he had smiled at her and said, "That's how a girl's pussy should smell!"

He did it again from time to time. It was only such things they could do. They could not sleep together before they were married. Their parents were strict about that.

She had told him that she drank her own pee on every full moon, but he had not been helpful. On the contrary, he had thought a moment and said that yes, that was right and that she should drink his pee as well, namely at each half-moon. She had agreed to do that, as well.

One day she had noticed a pee smell from his mouth. It was not the smell of her own pee. She had suspected that he had been with a girl who had peed on him. She had thought that such a girl would do that to mark him. In that way, other girls who smelled it would stay away from him. This had led to a quarrel between them that had caused them to split up. It was then that she had realised the importance of recognising her own pee smell.

However, in the end she had gone to her old friend Mirela and had told her about all the pee drinking. Mirela had told her that it was all nonsense and that Donka had been a bully.

After these thoughts, she winced a little there in the wagon where she was sitting. However, perhaps drinking one's own pee had not been a joke, anyway? Perhaps it is even useful for more things than to notice a strange pee smell from one's boyfriend? For example, to drink one's own pee when the driver did not bother to stop! She sat and wondered a bit. Damn! Why not try? She had done it many times before. Besides she was thirsty.

She looked around among all the things in the wagon to find a suitable place. Finally, she found a trunk. She cleared the room next to it. She sat down on the trunk, turned half way around away from the room she had cleared, and put her feet on the trunk. Then she leaned back and let herself sink into the space by the side of the trunk while she held on to things around her in order to keep from falling. After some effort, she succeeded so that she lay with her head on the floor. Her back was resting against the edge of the trunk, and her legs were hanging over her head. Her skirt had fallen over her face, but she pushed it away, so it came to hang over her chest and behind her butt.

Now her panties between her legs had come into view. She pulled them down her legs until they came to rest over her ankles. There is that big black pussy bush of mine, she thought.

She giggled as she looked at the pussy hairs strutting out between her thighs. Often, when she had pulled her panties up, and she looked down at herself, her panties bulged out in front of her pussy because of her long and stiff pussy hairs. However, now the thick bush of pussy hairs was a problem because she could not see in which direction the pee stream would come out of her pussy. Oh, well, she had to take that chance.

She opened her mouth so high and wide as possible. She started to pee, and she saw a thick, wide stream coming out of her pussy bush. Oh, no! The pee stream did not come straight out but to the side and had a greater force than she had expected. It did not hit her mouth and not even her face, but her hair on the top of her head. She heard the sound of pee splashing into her hair. Suddenly the wagon jerked � "Jacob!" she thought instantly.

The pee stream swung over her forehead and over to the other side of her head. She moaned as she tossed and swung her hips in order to change her pussy's position to make the stream hit her mouth. "Bad luck!" she thought when she saw the strong pee stream continue to drift from side to side while the pee kept pouring into her raven-black, curly hair. Now the pee starts flowing along the skin of my head, she thought. Oh, no � soon it will run out of my hair and all over the floor and soak the things that are lying around! She decided to stop peeing. Although she had peed just a few seconds, her beautiful curly gypsy hair was wet all through in several places.

Quickly she shifted along the trunk's edge, slid down to the floor, took hold of the trunk and pulled herself up into a sitting position. She grabbed her long hair where it was dry � down by the shoulders � and used it to wipe pee off her face. I have to keep the pee from running out of my hair and down my neck and onto my clothes, she thought. With her quick fingers, she began to rub the dry part of hair onto the wet part on top of her head. When she was finished, the moisture was distributed throughout her hair. "Oh, my hair is wet all through!" she thought. She looked around but discovered no wetness in the surroundings. At least it seems to have worked, she thought and consoled herself, it probably did because I was so fast!

She put one hand on the floor, grabbed the trunk with the other and got up. Her panties still hung over her ankles. Oh, she noticed two large wet spots on the front of them as she pulled them up. Well, that's not strange, she thought, my panties have clearly been hit directly by the pee stream � there's nothing to do with that. When she had pulled her panties up, she felt the wet pee in them on her stomach.

The wagon had only one proper piece of furniture, an exclusive dressing table. It had a large mirror and two side mirrors and light over the large mirror. She went over to the dressing table, sat down on the chair in front of it and looked at herself in the mirror. Her hair was twisted together into a tangle � it looked like a bird's nest! She pulled her hands through her &#8203;&#8203;hair to straighten it out, but it was not easy because of it being tangled together. She checked her hands. They were damp and smelled of pee. She looked around for something to wipe them off on, but found nothing she could use. How about her skirt?

No, she thought her panties would be better, because she washed them more often than her skirt. She lifted her skirt up and wiped her hands on her panties. She also wiped them off on the skin under her panties. She thought that she had wiped her hands thoroughly, but a smell test showed that her hands still smelled of pee. She decided not to worry about that any longer, but instead opened a drawer and took out a hairbrush. She began to comb the tangled and wet hair. The wetness had made &#8203;&#8203;the raven-black hair shiny and even blacker. After a while, her hair flowed beautifully down her shoulders. Pleased with the result, she smiled at herself in the mirror. Also, she found that her dress was hardly wet at all. She saw only a few wet spots on her blouse, but they would surely disappear quickly in the summer heat.

Suddenly she raised her head � did the wagon roll a bit slower? Would it stop? Yes, "Pee break!" Jacob shouted. She stood up, took her headscarf from her skirt pocket, tied it over her head, and went forwards in the wagon to Jacob. "Ahhhh! So now you finally stop," she said. "We must have another way of organising pee breaks!"

"But I cannot stop right in front of a house," Jacob said. "It does not matter, we can only pee in the ditch. We have done that before. I just tried to drink my own pee � that's how desperate I was! It would have worked if you had not made the wagon shake." Ho, ho, thought Jacob, that was an idea typical of Simza! He said, "Recycling! It is very modern these days."

"Maybe, but not when the stream hits me everywhere else!" Oh, well, he thought, that did not seem very good. He realised what had happened when he saw that pretty hair of hers. When her hair was dry, it was a bit unruly, but now the damp hair lay in neat folds over her forehead, and pretty waves of hair hang over her shoulders below her scarf. He said, "I'm sorry. I only meant to tease you a bit. I will not do it again." Maybe I should find a way to comfort her, he thought. "Maybe you want some nice cuddling in bed tonight as an apology?" he said. "And then be forced to use knitting needles to get rid of the foetus? No way!" she said. However, she had to admit to herself that she could use a good hug. Not from the rather slender Jacob, though but from a really strong guy. A guy who could give her a big hug, as if squeezing her body into his.

2. ON THE HILLSIDE

The wagon stopped, and she jumped out and down on the ground. She grabbed hold of her skirt, lifted it a bit, and started running. She ran up the hillside that was by the side of the road. She looked for a bush she could hide behind to pee. Now when she should get to pee, she had become pee desperate again. Her way of running was a little forced because in order to hold her pee back she had to concentrate on her pussy.

Behind a bend out of view from the wagon, a young man was walking along the road. In his hand, he carried a leather handbag with food he had just bought at the local store. He was thinking of the dance he was going to that night when he saw her. Hey, there's a girl running up the hill. She's a genuine gypsy girl, too, with a headscarf on her head, big golden ring in her ear, proper gypsy skirt and everything! What is she going to do up there? � If it's not to � He wondered.

On her way up the hill, she cast a glance to the side towards the road. She discovered the man on the road and she stopped and looked at him. She forgot about her pee desperation. He is probably one of those randy-men, she thought, smiling to herself. They were all the same. First they wanted her to lift her skirt, so they could see her panties. Then they wanted her to pull down her panties, so they could see her pussy. It was okay with her though � so long as they were generous with their money.

She wondered what he had in his bag. Maybe money? Yes, she thought, almost certainly, it is Saturday which is pay day for workers, and he is a real lumberjack, it is plain to see � she looked admiringly at his well-built body. She smiled slyly to herself � perhaps she should try one of her tricks on him?

She noticed that he had seen her. She smiled at him and said, "Hello." He said, "Good afternoon."

"Have you come from afar?" he asked. "Yes, we've traveled all day," she said and told him what city they came from. One word took the other, and after a while, he went up to her in the hill, stretched out his hand and said, "I'm Glen."

She looked down at her hand. It probably still smells of pee, she thought. Hesitantly she stretched out her hand and said, "And I'm Simza." He grabbed her hand and pressed it firmly in his fist. A sweaty hand, he thought, must be because of the hot day. She liked the feeling of his strong hand around hers.

"Are you thirsty?" he asked. She said yes, and he opened his bag and gave her a bottle of beer. He opened the bottle for her and then opened a bottle for himself. She sat down on a stone, and he sat down in the heather, in front of her. He held his leather handbag tucked under his arm. She took a gulp of beer and put the half-empty bottle in the heather next to the stone where she was sitting.

"Where does this road lead to?" she asked. "To the top of the valley and further across the mountains," he said. She listened to him while he talked about the places through which the road passed. She sat with her &#8203;&#8203;legs tightly together under her gypsy skirt, which reached down to her ankles. She thought that she had to make sure he did not see anything � yet.

"This valley is beautiful," she said, and he agreed. As he pointed them out, he told her the names of the individual farms they could see from where they were sitting.

It is time to tempt him a little, she thought. While she looked in the direction he was pointing, at a farm on the other side of the valley, she grabbed her skirt at the knees, lifted it and shook it � let it swing a bit in the air before she put it down so that the skirt edge came to rest on her knees. He glanced down at her brown legs. She noticed his gaze and smiled when he hesitated his words a bit.

"Oh, it's hot," she said. "Yes, it can be hot here in the mountains sometimes," he said and looked at her. She took off her headscarf, folded it and prepared to stick it behind the hem of her skirt � she did not want to use her skirt pocket to avoid getting pee smell into her skirt from her scarf, which had become damp from her wet hair. While she was fumbling with her &#8203;&#8203;scarf, she lowered a leg as if in distraction and let her thighs slip slightly apart.

Oh, her panties, he thought, slightly embarrassed. A moment he had gotten a peep under her skirt all the way up to her underpants. They are grey-white and have legs that extend down her thighs, he observed.

When she had finished putting her scarf away, she exclaimed, "Oh!" as if she had just discovered that her legs had come apart. "Excuse me!" she said and looked at him and laughed, a short trilling laugh, as she hastily put her legs together and grabbed her skirt and threw it about a bit to put it right.

He blushes, she thought, and he looks at my legs with big eyes � this is going to work out just fine. She chuckled.

"The sunlight blinds me," he said, and squinted against the sun, "I'll move a bit forward to get shade from that tree."

Oh, well, he can see my legs better from that position, she thought. She said nothing, only smiled at him as he moved.

When he had reached his new position, he saw a little of her brown thighs. "Her thighs are beautiful!" he thought, and continued, "I don't think she understood what was behind my little manoeuvre." He felt as if there was a lump forming in his stomach.

"What work do you do?" she asked. "I cut trees and load timber," he said and told her about the work in the forest. They had eye contact while he spoke.

"Tee hee � maybe he wants to see a little more?" she thought after they had talked for a while. As if by chance, she put her feet a bit apart.

Now he could see under her skirt and a bit up her thighs. My, oh, my, her panties again, he thought as he caught a glimpse of a leg of her panties. He felt his cheeks getting hot.

She noticed that her thighs had caught his attention again and that his eyes had grown larger.

He had stopped talking, but she continued to look at him. He found it a bit embarrassing, and to divert her attention, he nodded towards the horizon and said, "The highest peak over there is almost 5000 feet." She glanced toward the mountains. "Whew!" he thought, "That trick seemed to work, now she looks at the view again � I prefer the view between her legs!"

She looked at him through the corner of her eye. Now he peeks under my legs again, she thought. His cheeks are red, and his eyes are wide. Good God, I think he is getting horny already! He is truly excitable!

By the way, I feel quite excited myself, she admitted to herself. I just have to show him more to see how horny he gets � have to do it right away! She moved her knees slightly apart while she kept a close watch on how he was going to react.

Now he could see her panties up to her crotch and slightly further on to her stomach. Fascinated, he stared at the crotch of her panties� it looked like a white pussy! "Oh, oh, oh, what a fat pussy!" he thought, "Her pussy must be pressing behind her panties!"

He forgets himself completely, she thought, now he is sitting perfectly still just staring in between my legs!

This made her think. I can't believe it � a stranger looks up my skirts! Not that I have anything against it, though. She giggled. No, just go on peeping, my boy, for now you'll get to see some more! She put her knees together and pushed herself slightly forward right there on the stone where she was sitting.

Her having put her knees together had diminished his view, but her having moved her hips forwards had improved it. An 'Oh!' slipped out of him as he thought, "Cameltoe!" because now he could see her white fat pussy once again and this time with a pussy crack because now her panties were tightening around her pussy.

Now she got something else to think about because she needed to pee again. She put one leg over the other in order to put pressure on her pussy to reduce the need to pee. She tried to hide it by casually rocking her legs and looking across the landscape. He must not see me pee, she thought, wondering how she could get away, so she could pee in private.

Oh, her pussy passed out of view, he thought, disappointed. He saw that she straightened her back and squeezed her thighs tightly around her pussy. She must pee soon, he thought anxiously.

Maybe he understands it, she thought and smiled slightly. Maybe it does not matter if he sees it, on the contrary it might be an advantage � But was it safe, or would he do something foolish? She glanced at him. He seemed like a nice person. I'm certain that he won't do anything, she thought to reassure herself. She decided to reveal her need to pee for him.

She said cautiously as she looked around, "Excuse me, I must �." Then she directed her gaze straight at him and burst out, "Why, I have to pee!" The startled look on her face turned into a sweet, wide smile when she saw his reaction. He said a little embarrassed, "Oh, do you?"

"Yes," she said and broke out laughing. He ventured to add, "Do you really? Is it true that you truly must, I mean out of �" She realised that he was thinking about her pussy, but ignored it because she wanted to continue the conversation. She became a little bolder. "Don't you understand that I have to pee? Can't you see just by looking at me?" she asked. With a smile and with her head slightly tilted, she added, "Don't you have a girlfriend?"

"No," he said, "I thought �, I mean �, I thought you might need to do it, but did not know for sure that you did." She laughed. Now she felt totally free and threw all her inhibitions overboard. As a prank, she moved her hands to the bottom of her stomach, pressed them against her skirt in front of her pussy, pouted her lips, made big eyes, rocked from side to side and said, "Oh, I really need to pee now!" Then she looked at him with a broad smile and asked, "Do you understand now that I have to pee?"

"Yes," he said, "but I haven't seen a girl show it just like that."

"OK, but I really have to!" she said and added, "I also think that a girl should show her boyfriend everything!"

She wanted to tempt him further, play with him a bit. She straightened her back and asked, "Do you know how a girl pees?"

"Well, �" He hesitated. He stared at the bottom of her stomach where he knew that her pussy that needed to pee. He imagined how pee squirting out of it would look like. "Well, she pees with her pussy � haven't you seen that?" she said when she realised that he was not going to answer. "I've seen little girls on the beach do it," he said, "but never a grown woman, I don't know how that looks."

"O-K," she said thoughtfully, "do you know exactly where it comes out, then?" she said rhetorically, "Well, it flows out through the crack of her pussy." She added, "The stream can be thin or wide." To emphasize the truth of what she said, she lifted her head and pushed her chin out. Fascinated, he said nothing and kept watching her performance. "But do you know the sound of pee flowing through her &#8203;&#8203;pussy, then?"

"Well, I do not know quite how to describe the sound," he said. "It is a hissing sound," she said. "But it's probably depending on the girl?" he said. "I guess so, but in any case, the hissing sound is strong when she is desperate to pee, as I am now."

"Oh," he said, and after thinking for a moment, "I would like to hear that!"

"Oh, so you would, would you?" she said, looked at him and laughed, "I see!". Yes, wouldn't they all, she thought.

"Is she really going to pee right in front of my eyes?" he thought. He waited anxiously for what would happen next.

I will do it now and right here, she decided. It does not matter if he's looking. I will probably not meet him again anyway, and now I just have to pee! "Can you look away for a moment?" she said. "Okay," he said politely and turned away from her.

He held his bag firmly under his arm. She is probably good at stealing, he thought. From the corner of his eye, he saw that she put her hands up under her skirt, raised herself a little, pulled the part of the skirt she was sitting on backwards, pulled her panties down, and sat down on the stone again. She was now sitting with bare butt and pussy on the stone so that she could pee without wetting her clothing.

"Finished!" she said. He turned towards her. She had left her skirt hanging halfway down her lower legs to hide her underpants, which were hanging over her knees. Her naked pussy was visible under her skirt's edge, but not from where he sat. She looked at him. "Well, now, where were we � yes, you do not know how a girl pees �," she said. Like a school teacher, she put her palms together in front of her chest and looked thoughtfully across the valley towards the hills beyond, as if she was weighing her next words on a gold weight. She continued, "When a girl needs to pee, the first thing she has to think about is � sss � oh, excuse me, I peed! Did you hear that?"

"Is it true?" said he, amazed. He thought he had heard something from under her skirt, but was not sure. He bent forward towards her legs below her skirt's edge. She watched him closely as he moved. He noticed her look, but he had the impression that she did not mind. However, he was unable to bend far enough to look in between her legs.

"Yes, I peed," she said, "I was just sitting thinking and � sss � oh, I peed again!"

He was startled when he saw a small splash of pee hitting the heather between her feet. She hid a smile behind her hand, she had to laugh at him. He was not used to peeing girls, that's for sure!

"By Jove!" he called out. It had just slipped out of him. "Yes, it is sensational isn't it?" she said and giggled. Well, not really, she thought, girls do it several times a day, you know.

"It does not matter," he said when he had recovered from the shock, "it is more environmentally friendly to do it outside than on a toilet."

"Yes, and you were the one who gave me a beer, right?" she said, "And in this heat it goes through my body straight down to my cunt!"

She looked at him and wondered whether he would react to her way of stretching the truth, but no. He was concentrating on folding his hands, putting them in front of his knees and bending himself forwards even farther to try to peek under her skirt. Now the poor guy is just thinking of pussy, she thought, I will help him a bit.

She moved her knees slightly apart and continued, "In addition, I was desperate from the beginning. No, now I have to stop. Imagine, here I am sitting in front of a stranger, a gentleman, and � sss."

"Hey!" he exclaimed as a second stream of pee shot out between her feet. However, this time he began to laugh. He rolled round in the heather as he laughed more and more. His bag was lying behind him. Then he lay down in front of her legs, slightly to the side to avoid being too intrusive. She lifted her skirt and put it down on her knees as she smiled slyly.

Oh, her panties! He stared at the slightly ragged, grey underpants which hung over her knees. They had been stitched and patched in various places. "Had to be at least 20 years old!" he thought. She must have forgotten that her panties are hanging over her knees, he thought and looked up at her. He noticed her sweet smile and made himself &#8203;&#8203;a little braver. I want to see more, he thought, I'm sure she doesn't mind. He changed his position so that he stood on all fours, crawled forward and placed himself with his head under her skirt. Her underpants hung over his forehead. "Oh, there's a fresh smell of girlie pee in here!" he thought.

She giggled and thought, not that I have anything against it, but how about sticking one's head under the skirt of a stranger like that! He makes himself a laughing stock! He thought the same, but only barely before all his mental and physical resources again focused on gazing into the darkness under her legs. "Just have a good look," she said.

She is unusually generous, he thought, but without considering it further. He stuck his head further in between her legs. Her panties swept over his head, and his cheek stroked the skin of her leg. He enjoyed the softness of her skin against his cheek. He saw her butt crack between her thighs. It reached up to a dark, blurry area at the bottom of her stomach.

It does not look right that a girl lets a man go straight ahead like that, she thought, she has to defend herself with what she's got! She giggled.

Suddenly he was startled. A small jet came out of the dark area between her legs and headed straight against him. It must be pee out of her very pussy!

She laughed at his reaction. "You like peeing girls, don't you?" She had to ask to make sure. "Yes, I have to admit that," she heard spoken from under her skirt.

He wanted to see more of the dark area between her legs and pushed himself in between her legs. Willingly she pulled her thighs apart to make room for him. He felt her lower legs slide past both his shoulders. Her soft thighs slid along his cheeks.

Now he gets to see my cunt, she thought, with its big bush. She giggled.

He could see some wet streaks of pee on the stone where she sat. Now he got to see her pussy clearly. The dark area appeared not to be shadows, but her black, big pussy bush. He saw her pussy crack inside her bush.

Half of his body was now under her skirt. She could only see his butt beyond her skirt's edge. "Do you want me to pee again?" she said. He was now so close to her pussy that the next time she peed the stream had to hit him. He said yes, and soon a quick spray came out of her pussy. The pee hit his chin.

Now he will get a real splash, she thought.

He saw a large, wide stream forcing itself out of her pussy. The stream hit him right in the face. He had to close his eyes to avoid getting pee in his eyes. He made a jerk and his head hit her skirt. He heard her laugh. It seems that she finds it just as fun as I do, he thought.

Now pee squirted everywhere. Wet droplets ran down the inside of both her &#8203;&#8203;thighs. The hissing sound from her pussy was strong.

She stopped peeing, and he noticed that she heaved herself a little. Next time I had better drink, he thought. Her pussy moved a bit, and now he saw some of her pussy lips inside her bush.

"Success!" she said to herself as she sat down again, and aloud she said, "Oh, well, that's it then. Now I'd rather pee properly because I just have to do it!"

"Just go on weeing!" he said. To open her pussy, she pushed herself backwards on the stone where she was sitting.

Now he could see her dark secret cave. That's where one would put one's cock to fuck her, he thought.

Now my pussy is wide open, she thought. My piss flaps do not hide my pee hole so that pee will pass through freely. I hope the stream will hit him right in the face!

He lifted his head and opened his mouth. A thin but powerful stream struck out of her hairy pussy. He aimed in so as to make the stream hit him right in the throat. He concentrated on swallowing the pee as fast as possible to keep up with her pissing.

She concluded with a few small tinkles of pee. He had not believed it was possible to pee that long. There is no more pee on my thighs, she thought, I wonder why.

She pulled up her skirt, so he could get out. "How was it under there?" she asked. "Wonderful," he said as he stood up. "So it wasn't terribly wet, then?" she asked. "I managed," he said, he felt pee sloshing inside his stomach.

Well, well, she thought, maybe he still needs some consolation? She decided to show herself to him. She pulled her skirt up to her stomach and spread her thighs as far as her knickers round her knees allowed. She smiled sweetly up at him and said, "Wanna have an extra look?". Now he saw her pussy in broad daylight for the first time. The splendour of her black, hairy pussy surrounded by the light brown skin of her belly and thighs glared into his eyes. "It's the most beautiful pussy I've ever seen," he said, it just slipped out of him. "Thanks," she said, she could see that he meant it.

He stretched out his hand to touch her &#8203;&#8203;pussy. She intercepted his hand by pushing it kindly, but firmly aside. He was disappointed but did not show it. She drew her panties up and let her skirt down.

He pulled her up to him and took her in his arms. He stroked her beautiful gypsy hair. It felt soft and pleasant, rich in a way, almost moist, he thought.

She looked at him. "How does one tell one's boyfriend that one's hair is wet of one's own piss?" she thought.

He had seen gypsy hair several times, and he thought it was beautiful, but he did not know how it smelled. He bent his head forward. She tried to push him away, but too late. He smelled various places in her hair. The smell was oddly familiar in an exciting way.

When he withdrew she looked anxiously at his face � what would he say? "Your hair has such an exotic smell!" he said, thrilled. "Gee! If that's how you like it, it's OK with me," she said and smiled with relief. She came to think of the boyfriend she had when she was young, the one who had been so fond of her pussy smell. "Some like pussy smell, some like pussy pee smell, and some like both!" she thought and giggled to herself.

Then he kissed her lips. When they finished kissing she thought, didn't it taste �? Immediately, she kissed him again. She pushed her tongue against his teeth. Willingly he opened his mouth. Her tongue played with his tongue. Excited, she tilted her head so that his mouth made a right angle with her mouth so that her long tongue could come as far into his mouth as possible, almost to his throat. "Must make sure he does not have to puke!" she thought. Yes, it was as she thought. She recognised the taste of her own pee, the taste she had been familiar with since childhood. So that was where her piss had gone!

She finished kissing him and smiled at him. She chuckled. Pee drinking might prove to be practical, she thought, just imagine having such a man in the wagon when I need to pee, and the pot could not be found or was not available, and Jacob refused to stop! I could just lay him down, open his mouth, open my pussy with my fingers and put my pussy over his mouth and go ahead peeing so that the pee gurgled down his throat and filled his belly! After an hour or so it would be his problem to get Jacob to stop for a pee break, and with as big fists as his, he should be able to cope with Jacob and his tender fiddle player's hands. She thought that Donka had not been a bully but a genius! Unless �, maybe he would let the other girls pee into his mouth too so that his stomach got all filled up. On the other hand, maybe he would do the same with me, she thought, put his cock into my mouth and piss down my throat and into my stomach.

He stroked her hair tenderly. Her beautiful hair framed a somewhat narrow and long face with a long nose and big dark eyes. Was she his fate? He could be wrong though � maybe it was just his fascination with the smell of her hair.

"Oh, you are beautiful," he said. She smiled, tossed her head, looked straight into his eyes and said, "I hardly know you, sir, but I can reveal to you that today I have had the honour of sharing the contents of my pee bladder with you." What? He did not get it. Was she joking? He said, "What do you mean?"

"Some I peed into my hair, and some I peed into your mouth," she said.

Then she told him about her trying to drink her own pee in the gypsy wagon. "You are a brave girl," he said, kissed her hair and gave her a big hug. She closed her eyes as she enjoyed his two strong arms around her back.

Then he pushed her away, swung her to the side, and put his arm around her back. With arms around each other's back, they walked down to the road. She said, "Are you coming to the market on Sunday? We are there, and I can tell your fortune!"

"Yes, I think so," he said, "and I would like to have my fortune told."

Oh, he was about to forget his bag! He ran back and fetched it. Strange, he could not remember he had put it right there! Never mind, it had probably been pushed aside during the heat of the battle, so to speak.

When he turned around he was surprised to see that she had already reached the road and was busy climbing into the gypsy wagon � he just saw the butt of her gypsy skirt as it disappeared into the back of the wagon.

"Where were you?" asked Jacob as Simza climbed into the wagon, it was his turn to be annoyed. "I've just been peeing," Simza said cheerfully and slipped into the back of the wagon. What a change in mood, he thought, suddenly everything seems to be fine again! He smiled after her. Then he turned round and started the wagon.

Glen ran down to the road and looked at the wagon as it moved away to see if he could get a last glimpse of her � and, yes, there he saw her just as the wagon disappeared behind a bend, she waved at him through an opening in the back of the wagon.

He started walking home to his cabin.

3. IN THE CABIN

He arrived at his cabin. He opened the door, threw his leather handbag into a corner, and closed the door behind him.

In the evening as was changing his clothes to go to the Saturday night dance he thought he needed to take some money with him. He went over to the corner where he had left his bag, opened it and took out the envelope containing his pay. He opened the envelope and looked into it but discovered to his amazement that half of the money was gone.

As he stood there with the thin envelope in his hand, he became angry with the gypsy girl because he suspected that she had stolen the money. He was angry with himself too � how stupid he had been! She had said that girls ought to show their boyfriends everything, but he was just a stranger, at least when she said it � he became thoughtful.

However, after thinking about it till the next day, he found that the incident had been so unique that it was worth the money, and perhaps she had more need of the money than he did. Moreover, she had shown regard for him by leaving half of the money to him. However, he decided not to go to the market.
