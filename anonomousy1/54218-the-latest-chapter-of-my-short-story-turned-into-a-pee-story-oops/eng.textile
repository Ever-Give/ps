Brief intro to the story before this chapter:

A young man 18-19 protests spur of the moment as the economy has ruined his life with tuition fee rises and lack of employment. He hadn't thought the whole thing through much and is acting out of character, angry etc. Oh and in total the guy is there between 6 and 7 hours in time. I have editted the parts I've put in down a bit so it gets to the relevent parts. If you want the action really quick then skip to paragraph 5 where the tramp comes over to speak to the character. Enjoy.

I struggled not to throw up as I gulped back a tonne of water trying for the fourth time to swallow the key to the padlock. So there I was chained to the flagpost in front of the civic centre.

I pulled out my card and some markers.

«More jobs, less mobs» I wrote in big black marker. No, that was just a rhyme for the sake of rhyming. It was in no way descriptive of my situation. No writing poetry. Just KISS (keep it simple stupid). Simple and to the point. Could always just stick them to the post I'm on.

«JOBS FOR THE YOUTH!»

«FAIRER BENEFITS!»

«DO YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR CHILDREN AND GRAND CHILDREN ON THE STREETS?» That might work. Oh stuff it. It'll do. Oh, and one more:

«I WILL NOT BE MOVED UNTIL I'M EMPLOYED OR I GET BACK MY BENEFIT!»

«WE ARE YOUR FUTURE. YOU WANT A FUTURE OF POVERTY? NO ONE TO CARE FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE OLD. NO? THEN EMPLOY SOMEONE UNDER THIRTY!»

«DON'T BE SHIRTY. EMPLOY UNDER THIRTY!» Damn it, maybe I should have thought this out. Pick one, or swap between them. Shame conciseness and clarity in getting my point across were never my strong point. Oh who cares! I can speak well. This is making a point in itself. Perfect place to get students onside too. It's about twelve now, people will soon be on their lunch breaks. Perfect sunny day to sit in the Civic's grounds. Nice peaceful sandwich with some angry teen shouting down your ear chained to a post. This may not go down to well. Maybe I should just let the visual do the work and be quiet. People can read right. I began to get a little bit nervous. Swallowing the key to the padlock was not the best of plans. Plus I'd drank a lot of water trying to help it go down, which was making its way to my bladder gradually. I tried not to think about it though, it's not like I had to pee much, just a faint first urge.

Skipped a bit

«DON'T BE SHIRTY. EMPLOY UNDER THIRTY! Youth are your future! How can we get experience if no one will employ us. DON'T BE SHIRTY. EMPLOY UNDER THRITY!» This time I shout louder and for a moment I think it's worked. A young attractive alternative looking girl coming down the steps from Newcastle University holding some books and carrying a hippy style cloth bag across her body smiles at me and then turns her back to me as she enters Blackwells bookshop. Damn, she looked friendly too. I begin to get bored and wish I had a pen and paper to write or maybe some credit on my phone to go online or text someone. It looks like this is going to take longer than I thought.

Skipped a bit more

Just when I was getting tired and fed up a slightly tatty looking man walk purposefully towards me smiley broadly. Cool, another unemployed soul who understands. Smells a lot and looks like a tramp, but at least he understands. I can be the before, he can be the after.

«You alright fella?» He grinned an unusual grin. «You seem to know what it's all about my friend? Spare some change for a man who understands more than you know?» He asks me, and I realise now why his grin looked strange. It was that grin you give someone when you're passing pleasantries before you ask them a favour. I rustled in my pocket. I don't often give money to beggars, but I kinda hoped that he would seek acquaintance in me if I helped him out. That, or he was just lying to get my money. That was probably the most likely explanation, but I took a chance anyway. This was the only person who had approached me in a positive manner so far today. I was enjoying the attention and it was nice to be smiled at.

«There you go. It's nice to get some support, its hard work isn't it. Being ignored and looked at like you're shit?»

«Thank you fella.» He looked hungry for the money and practically torn my arm off with the �2. «Well done. You're putting up a good fight. Keep it up friend.» He had his back to me now and was walking away with a slight hop in his step, or maybe a limp, I wasn't sure. And just when I thought he'd forgotten about me, he turned and spoke to me quietly so that I almost had to read his lips

«Watch you don't wet yourself though mate. It's not worth it - Thanks again fella, really.» He then smiled the hugest smile and ran away.

Oh, shit how embarrassing. I felt my face redden again. Yes, I had to pee but I didn't realise it was obvious. I'd shifted my weight a little when I'd been waving my banners but I thought it had just looked like I was enthusiastic and anxious to be heard. Now he mentioned it though I had been holding it for a good two hours since my urge to pee had become more prominent and I had been getting desperate over the last hour. I had just managed to distract myself by playing mind games to do with counting car registrations and also reading old texts and listening to music. Heck I'd even played solitaire for the best part of the last hour.

That had distracted me a lot from my bladder, as had sitting down. Sitting always makes things easier. Standing here now though, as the cars swarmed the roads nearby, the noise rose and the busybodies power-walked past more often I found my bladder to be growing increasingly more heavy. It even ached a little bit when I shifted my weight casually from leg to leg. What if I did wet myself? No, surely not. I've not done that since I was 6 years old. Oh my god a grown man wetting themselves. That WOULD get in the papers. The thought made me very nervous which didn't help my situation and nor did my dry throat as it caused me to cough.

I pushed my thighs together. I must resist this I willed myself. It's so busy, I must concentrate. This is my biggest chance to get support. I picked up a banner again, this time bending it back and forth and holding it tightly in my hands in desperation. It was nice to have it there as a distraction and something to fiddle with. Though standing was becoming increasingly uncomfortable. I had to keep moving but at the same time it hurt to. I don't think I had ever been this desperate before.

Once it got to 6pm and the man and woman from the Civic along with their colleagues had long gone after first all trying to get rid of me. The man had told me that he was calling the police as soon as he got home, but it had been an hour now and no one had bothered me. I had resorted to sitting down in a most peculiar way. I was resting on one heel and rocking gently but mostly leaning back to lessen the pressure and the pain. I had gone very quiet and had only spoken occasionally when there were more people round. I had shouted a lot at first but by now my throat was really sore and I could hardly speak.

This really wasn't looking good for me. I had considered peeing on the ground discreetly but it was way too busy here in rush hour. I didn't want people seeing my penis. It was getting really bad now though. I was in so much pain and I kept getting spasms which really hurt my penis as I concentrated hard on squeezing my muscles together. I was sweaty and weak from holding on so long. I felt almost ill, this couldn't be good for my health at all and the lack of water was giving me a headache. If I hadn't swallowed the damn key I could have let myself free and find a wall to nip behind or something.

«Oh god» I whispered as the thought of peeing behind something caused another twinge in my nether regions. I was really starting to doubt being able to wait until it was quiet. I wonder what people thought when they were walking past. I'm sure I had been moaning under my breath on and off for at least half an hour now. What a wuss though. I mean a man should just have the bottle to whip it out wherever and pee. I guess I didn't want people to think any less than they already did of me though. I mean it wouldn't look good for my case; indecent exposure. At around 6.30 I had actually started to squirm and was so desperate to grab my penis with both hands to stop from losing control of my pure bladder but I knew that would be entirely inappropriate.

«Oh fuck this.» I groaned and attempted anxiously to unchain myself, but failed miserably. I felt trapped. This was my worst nightmare. All the stresses of the day came flooding back along with the possibility and pain of my now rock hard and extremely heavy bladder. I lay down on the ground and closed my eyes. As I did I realised that they were a little bit wet. I know I wasn't crying but I felt pretty bad. The pain in my heart and in my head and in my bladder was excrutiating. I never knew that your bladder could hurt that much. I'd never heard of desperation like this. Just then someone kicked me in the side.

«Get up you tramp!» They smirked at me.

«FUCK OFF!» I yelled with a lame attempt at a kick that sent shockwaves through my bladder which made me double over and grab my penis with both hands. This seemed to confuse the small group of lads and they left me alone laughing loudly «He's gonna piss himself!» I sure was, I thought. No No NO! Not now.

«I must hold on. I must hold on I must hold on.» It took me a while to realise I was actually saying this out loud to myself as I rocked back and forth. And then it happened. I started to lose control of my bladder. One tiny little drop at a time and it hurt so badly for it to stop at the tiny drops but at least they wouldn't show. When would these bloody people go away! I was so desperate for rush hour to go away now. Why had I chosen a Friday? People were drinking after work. It was horrible how many students walked past smirking as they saw me in agony. One older lady however, did take pity.

«Are you alright?» She asked me. «You look in a lot of pain young man? Would you like to borrow my phone and we can call your mother or someone?»

«No thank you mam, I've just got a bad cramp is all. It'll pass.» Not sure why I said mam. That was a lot more polite than I usually was. I don't think I'd ever called her mam. God I hope no one I know comes past, please no one I know come past. I lay down again to take the weight off my bladder. The floor was cold and hard but that was the least of my worries.

I was completely zoned out from everything when someone tapped me on the shoulder gentley.

«Are you ok?» It was the girl from the book shop. «I saw you earlier and I think what you're doing is brilliant.» She smiled a friendly comforting smile. «It's good that you're still here after all of this time.» She kept talking like women do and all I could do was listen. I had no energy to talk and all my concentration was on my poor bladder. I rocked back and forth gently. «Seriously though, are you ok?» She asked again with a look of genuine concern. «You look like you're in pain or something.» Should I tell her I've started to wet myself? God no! And anyway I haven't. Not yet anyway.

«Shhh!» I realised I'd said it out loud.

«What's up?» She probed.

«N-n-nothing.» God I sounded like a tool. My voice was broken, almost a whisper, the way people speak when they're trying not to cry.

«It doesn't sound like nothing.» She said. «Have you been hurt or something?»

She paused and looked at me in wander and then I got an enormous spasm from my bladder and moaned loudly as I grabbed my penis tightly with both hands and rocked frantically.

«Oh, erm, do you erm. D-do you need to pee or something?»

I just looked at her with pleading eyes.

«It's so busy here.» I choked. She looked at me with sympathetic and loving eyes, then took a glance around the area.

«It's calmed down a lot in the last fifteen minutes.» She said. «I mean there's no one here, just mostly passing on the path outside this garden, I'll bet no one would notice if you were discreet about it...» She smiled at me and then giggled. «I'm sorry.» She said. «It's just I don't think I've ever seen a guy need to pee so much in my life.»

I couldn't help but giggle a little, but shouldn't have, because in that moment a small squirt of warm pleasurable wetness pooled around my penis soaking into the material of my boxers.

«Ohhh God! Oh Shit oh shit!» I almost cried.

«Get it out!» She tentatively opened my flies and released my now slowly pissing cock from my jeans and then carefully from my dampening boxers. How bloody embarrassing I thought, especially since I had started peeing with full force when her hand was still there.

Chapter 4

I couldn't help but moan a pleasurable moan as my pee gushed out pooling very quickly on the ground around me. I was crouched down and couldn't feel my legs but the relief was so intense and sensual, almost like an orgasm. I had been so desperate and she had just stayed there beside me the whole time watching. And then when I was finished an even more embarrassing thing happened. I got a damn hard on. I tried to hide it by putting it swiftly back into my pants but could not as she had not let her eyes off my cock for the entire two or three minutes I'd peed. She leaned in and kissed me sensually.

«S-sorry.» She apologised in a small voice.

«What for?» I asked, confused.

«I shouldn't have - I'm sorry I didn't mean to - I I - It just looked so pleasurable. You looked so relieved, so so so -»

«It's ok.» I whispered. «I know. I'm kind of surprised by it myself.» I looked into her eyes and my face moved itself closer to hers as my hands grabbed her face gently by the ears and then moved under her chin as I kissed her sensually.

«I need to go again now would you believe.» I laughed.

«Wow. That's a lot of pee.» She laughed and leaned in to kiss me again, this time as I was peeing. She was a lot less careful this time. She pulled me close and possessed my mouth passionately.
