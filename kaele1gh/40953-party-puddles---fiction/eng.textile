I hope you will like this~ it is fictional, but hey~! i am always open to improving, so feel free to help me:

Krystal looked at herself critically in the mirror, raising an eyebrow and inspecting her image carefully, then sighed. The reflection sighed back and she giggled. Her dark brown almost black eyes sparkling, her lips curving upwards causing slight dimples in her cheeks. She was a pretty girl even if she did not always believe it. She had striking eyes which were almost always sparkling with friendship and mischief, and lips almost always ready to curve into a smile, with white almost even teeth underneath which flashed whenever she smiled or laughed. She had curly dark brown hair with red high and low lights that sparkled in the sun. She was curvy with large firm, round breasts, rounded hips and a round firm butt. She was critical of her legs, but her calves were shapely tapering to slender ankles and pretty feet. Her toenails were almost always painted brightly and she loved walking barefoot.

In fact the tight black dress she was wearing tonight with black high heeled strappy shoes was most unlike her normal dress of t-shirts and shorts or jeans. The dress has a sweetheart bodice cut low over her golden cleavage, and finished sufficiently high enough above the knee to be interesting without being too short for comfort. She had been looking forward to this all month, knowing he would be at the party~! Thinking of Chris's handsome face and wide smile made her heart beat faster... perhaps, perhaps... just perhaps tonight he would notice her?~! With that thought, Kryssie grabbed her small clutch purse and left, eager to get to the party.

Kryssie was enjoying herself already, sipping wine spritzers, chatting, meeting other people she knew from uni. Standing back a little against a wall she could feel the slight buzzed feeling she got from wine and smiled. It felt nice. Suddenly across the room she saw Chris and her heart lurched. As the captain of both the rugby and athletics teams he was of course surrounded by gorgeous girls and Kryssie sighed, any thought she had entertained of going over to chat faded abruptly. She could not compete with the cheerleading squad, she decided grimly, and went to fetch some more alcohol to numb her pain, this time getting herself a large plastic cup of beer. A number of guys asked her to dance and she smiled and laughed and chatted with them, never one to ever wish to be rude or hurt anyone else's feelings, but she steadfastly managed to avoid dancing with anyone.

Feeling more than a little buzzed now, Kryssie realised her coordination was somewhat affected and tried to remember how much beer she had had, and whether she had eaten or not. She felt okay though, far from drunk and as yet far from the terribly embarrassing consequences. However, she did realise her bladder was really full. Glancing around she realised how many people had paired off, clinging to each other on the dance-floor, kissing on the couches, standing necking in doorways. «Great,» she said through her teeth. «JUST what I need - a reminder I have nobody to snog~!» Feeling another twinge in her bladder she decided to look for a loo she vaguely remembered being told there were three in the house. The downstairs one was occupied by a couple who barely looked up when she entered, just yelling at her to close the door. She giggled and felt a warm flush of excitement flood through her. Seemed to her they would be busy a while.

Tripping a little up the stairs, and giggling as she did so, she found the other guest toilet locked and there was no response at her banging. Sighing and feeling her bladder now really twingeing she made her way to the main bedroom for the last loo. She swung open the door and found this room was also occupied by several couples who were... she giggled again as the word came into her mind... coupling. She stood a while looking, again feeling more than a little turned on by the couples enjoying themselves in various states of undress. Then she tried to get past to the bathroom, but it too was occupied and as she approached the door was unceremoniously slammed in her face. A little startled, she flinched then sighed, and picked her way back out of the room.

More banging on the other locked up stairs loo yielded no results, and after making her way back downstairs she found the downstairs loo was also now locked. Damn~! She fidgeted a little, as her bladder throbbed. Shit~! She really needed to pee~! She wondered if she should go home, but after considering it she realised she would not make the long walk back. Unconsciously her one hand slid down to the space between her lower tummy and her groin, and pushed slightly as a small soft groan escaped. In addition to being desperate to pee she was also feeling incredibly turned on by all the couples she had seen. In fact she realised with surprise, her swollen bladder was making her even hornier than normal However, despite that, she really needed to go.

Kryssie looked around, not seeing anywhere to relieve herself. Then she looked through the patio doors and saw a possible outlet ~! The garden~! She made her way through the couples making out and side-stepped the drunk singles lurching about to find herself outside. She looked around, and saw bushes on the other side of the pool. They ought to do! She walked as fast as her strappy high heels could take her to the seclusion of the patch of flowery bushes.

Chris was bored. He had hoped the party would be fun but so far he had been disappointed. He knew most guys envied him, he was tall, muscular, with blonde hair and blue eyes and an easy smile. He was always surrounded by gorgeous young girls with perky breasts and long tanned legs. He sighed. But what most did not seem to care about, was the vapid look in their eyes. As he sighed, the blonde head between his knees stopped bobbing and Sherilyn looked up at him, lips wet, to see what the matter was. He pushed her head down again and she dutifully bobbed and weaved. He smiled a little, ok, so there were some perks... He closed his eyes and relaxed until he heard Sherilyn squeak and then withdrew her mouth quickly, spitting as she did so.

When he finished he zipped up as Sherilyn stood and tried to hug him. He felt a little bad about it, but the fact was, he really did not want to spend any more time with her. He smiled at her as nicely as he could and told her she was wonderful, and she beamed. Then he told her he had to pee, she should go have some fun, and he would find her later. Her smile dimmed but she trotted off and he could soon hear her and her friends giggling delightedly and vacuously. He sighed again and walked to the house, grabbing yet another beer as he went. He really DID need to go. He walked through the house, soon realising there was no way he could get into any of the toilets.

Grabbing yet another beer he decided he had had enough for now and walked outside, eventually leaning in the dark against a tree hidden from the hordes by shrubs. He lit a cigarette and unzipped himself. He was not yet desperate but his bladder was full. He loved the feeling of a full bladder, somehow it always made his cock semi hard. He was amazed it was semi hard now as he had just had a blow job from Sherilyn, but it was, and he ran his fingers over it, anticipating the sweet feel of relief he would have as he let himself pee...

He was lost in his own thoughts of how much he enjoyed holding and then releasing his own pee, something he had always thought kinda weird, but which he indulged in whenever he could, when he heard a noise. He looked up and watched as a curvy young woman came through the shrubs. He stared as she bent over double, heard her groan, saw her put her hands up between her legs and press into her groin, and he felt himself harden as he watched. She looked around, and he admired her nice round butt and large firm breasts encapsulated in the tight black dress as she did so.

Then she reached under her dress and pulled her panties down and neatly stepped out of them. Her dress was tight, fitting, and she had no choice but to hike her tight skirt up to her waist and then squat, legs wide open. He could not tear his gaze away as she used her chin to hold her skirt up and then used her hands to slightly open her pussy lips. He knew he should make a noise, let her know he was there but he was spellbound.

Kryssie was so desperate by the time she got through the bushes she already felt a few drops escape and had to bend over and push her hands between her knees hard against her groin to stop the flow. Once she had control again she quickly looked around then slipped off her panties.

The damn dress was too tight to allow her to squat so she hiked it up and secured one end under her chin. Then she squatted down, legs wide open. She used her hands to open her pussy lips slightly, enjoying the sudden kiss of cold night air. She was so desperate she was making little noises, yet she found herself first reaching up to touch herself and was surprised at how swollen and slippery her clit was. She ran a finger over it in circles and her eyes closed as she moaned. Then she looked around nervously, but nobody seemed to have heard. She closed her eyes again and holding herself open she concentrated hard and a small clear squirt escaped, soaking into the grass. She moaned softly again, damn that felt good. Whew. The squirt had removed some of the pressure, and she reached down and rubbed her clit again and oh wow it felt good. She was amazed at just how much her full bladder was enhancing her sexual feelings.

She rubbed a while then let go another squirt. It wet the fingers that were on her clit, and as the spurt also soaked into the grass, she absently lifted her finger to her mouth and licked the drops. She was a little shocked, she had never ever done this before, or even thought of it, but she found she half liked the sweet yet salty taste. She looked down at herself and giggled. She wondered if she was very drunk, but decided she was not that drunk. Just then her bladder spasmed again and reminded her she NEEDED to go, but she was having fun, so she again only allowed a small spurt to escape. And then she rubbed her clit again and even let her middle finger slide inside, before bringing it out and sucking it. She was completely lost in these new discoveries, so when she realised there was someone walking towards her, she got such a fright, she toppled over landing on her bum on the grass.

Chris watched the girl as she squatted to pee and when he saw her first play with herself he felt his cock throb. Wow. This was so hot. Then as he watched her squirt a small stream into the grass his cock bucked in his hand and his bladder constricted reminding him how full it was. He watched as she licked her finger and felt himself hardening even more. By the time she slid a finger insider herself and sucked it, he was lost and he found himself moving towards her...

As Kryssie squealed and overbalanced, he felt as if he was waking from a dream and felt himself flush with embarrassment. With his hardened penis still sticking out he reached out a hand to help the poor girl up and half recognised her form some of his classes. «Krystal?» He asked quizzically and the dazed girl nodded.

«Sorry,» he stammered...»I ... ummm...I was just about to ...» he was glad it was dark and she could not see him blushing. «I was about to take a leak when ... well..» he trailed off. Kryssie was desperately hiking down her skirt and he gathered she was probably blushing just as much. She had her face cast down and she was pushing at the hand he had on her arm from helping her up. He reached out and caught her other arm in his other hand. «Hey,» he said softly. «Stop now, I am so so sorry to have intruded... I ... it's just...» She looked up at him and even in the dark he saw the intensity in her dark eyes, the humiliation, and to his chagrin a tear escaped. «No, no Krystal, please, please do not cry,» he said softly and she stopped struggling and looked up at him

«but, but..» she began.»You SAW... you saw what I was do �ing» she said a tearful hiccup breaking her voice.

«I did,» he said softly, his finger on her chin forcing her to look at him as he nodded. «I did, Krys, I did, and it was the hottest thing I have ever ever seen... « He said earnestly. She stopped struggling and looked at him.

«Really?» she asked her voice quivering less now.

«YES,» he said loudly, and he reached down to kiss her. Kryssie felt his lips on her and melted with a soft murmuring sound, against him. The passion was overwhelming and soon he was fumbling with her zip and she with his clothes. His hand found her wet pee soaked pussy and he groaned. This time he brought his fingers to his lips and sucked. Wow, it tasted good. Kryssie watched and laughed. She had dreamt of being with Chris so many times in the darkness of her own bedroom, she had just never thought it would be her need to pee that would make him notice her.

But. She looked at him earnestly «I still need to pee», she muttered embarrassed again, and as her hand was fondling his hardness she felt how it bucked when she said that and her eyebrows raised. This time it was Chris who was flustered as he quietly explained how much peeing in general turned him on and how he so wanted to watch her pee. He hesitated waiting for her to slap him and storm away. But Kryssie, who had never thought of peeing as foreplay, was intrigued, she still remembered the wonderful feelings from earlier when she had been so horny and how good peeing from a full bladder had felt. Besides Chris was her fantasy man, if he liked this how could she say no? Looking up at him she told him she wanted to watch him pee too.

Chris coughed then admitted nervously that he could not pee whilst completely hard like now. She giggled and thought about then said «Hmmm...Well then we better do something about that then...» and she slowly lowered herself to the ground, naked, arms outstretched.

Chris did not hesitate and he felt thrills run though him as she gasped when he entered her. Oh gosh, she was so wet and hot and tight and they both felt the passion building quickly and furiously. Kryssie felt she was in a dream, and was smiling and murmuring loudly. Chris whispered to her that he was going to cum soon, and she bit her lip before admitting she too was so close to cumming, but she was also scared, she was not sure she could hold her bladder if she let go and gave in to her orgasm. Chris stopped mid stroke and looked down at her. «Don't try, Kryssie,» he said earnestly. «Let go... just let it all go...»
