I thought at first to leave this scene to your imaginations. Then I thought, Fuck that.

Daniel screamed as he sprayed his seed deep into the islander's tight, wet hole, and heard her moan in his ear, squeezing his cock as hard with her inside muscles as she was squeezing his body with her arms and legs. The two of them collapsed onto the sand, gasping for breath, still locked together. It took him a moment to recover, or perhaps longer; he was not afterward sure how long he lay on top of her, floating on the residual waves of orgasmic pleasure, before he came to himself enough to feel her nipples flattened against his chest and the soft sand against his shins.

He rolled over and sat up, pulling his softening organ out of her with a quiet sucking sound and a little spray of whatever mixture of their fluids now filled her love-hole, and wiped himself on the sand. The remnants of the islanders' simple feast still lay on woven mats on the beach and all around, the screwing had commenced. Every female on Island 53 who'd had her bleeding appeared to be on this beach with a cock in her, and the air was full of the sounds of lovemaking.

To Daniel's left, Jordan, his shirt half-unbuttoned and his pants around his ankles, was reaming a nut-brown girl with a woven band around her ankle who gasped with a sound like hiccupping, and Bill was lying on his back just beyond, his cock sticking out through his unbuttoned flies, while a fair-haired girl straddled him and impaled herself on it.

Farther off, Jimmy, completely naked with a sheen of sweat over his body and his flaccid manhood dripping, was drinking water from a bucket using a ladle while three island men took their women around him. Even a pair of goats, doubtless wandered away from the village's herd, were going at it in the grass at the inner edge of the beach. The wall, with the gate through which they'd entered open, loomed over everything, though the morning sun currently cast its shadow on the far side.

He glanced back at the girl he'd just filled with his seed, a fit, young thing with beautiful, brown eyes and large, bouncy breasts. She had raised herself to a squatting position, his seed dripping out of her hairy hole, and was pissing happily on the sand. "That was amazing," he told her, truthfully. "I'm sorry, what was your name?"

"Brin, Father Sea Lord. And your penis made me happy, too."

"Oh, I'm not a father yet," he said, absently. "Brin, do you know a woman named Cat?" It was a question he'd asked on eight different islands, now. This was the third on their current voyage; and, with the children the people of this island had too-willingly handed over, their hold was full and they would be heading home on the evening tide. Five of the islands had apparently had no resident named Cat. On Island 27, Cat had been a child much too young to have birthed a baby, while on Island 34, she was the head of the child-herds.

Neither fit the description the intoxicatingly beautiful slave girl had given him in a warehouse by the Jurhold docks, while screwing him expertly on a pile of rags formerly used as packing material. He had at first thought that he would screw her and conveniently forget about the task she'd given him; but he found himself repeating the words often in his hammock at night, and even while masturbating alone in the rigging during the midnight watch: "I will find a woman named Cat, a middle-aged agricultural worker who has lost an heir. I will tell her that I have met Kala, and she is well and happy and does God's work all the time. Then I will ask her about the third field." It had become something of an obsession.

"Mother Cat?" Brin responded, dismissively. "She's old. If you want to do more ploughing, my vagina's younger and it's right here." She smiled at him hopefully.

Daniel gestured ruefully at his cock. "I'd love to, but this isn't going to be hard enough for a few minutes. In the meantime, I'd really like to talk to Cat. If she's an agricultural worker."

Brin gave him a puzzled look. "She is an agricultural worker." She hesitated, then sighed and pointed off up the beach. "Do you see that sea lord with the big moustache?"

"That's Al."

"Well, he's ploughing Cat right now."

Daniel thanked her and picked up his pants, which he'd dropped in the sand after Brin had asked so nicely for the use of his cock. He wandered slowly up the beach to give Al time to finish up, pulling his sweat-stained, canvas shirt off over his head so that he was naked as a slave and stopping to drink from the same bucket as Jimmy had used. By the time he got to the place, Al was washing his cock in the ocean while the woman he'd been with was resting for a moment on the sand, seed dribbling out of her love-hole and sweat beading on her tanned skin. Daniel wondered if "old" meant something different in islander slang: the woman, while unquestionably older than Brin, couldn't possibly have seen more than two score of years. Though she showed the first signs of wrinkles on her face, especially about her eyes and lips, her skin was largely smooth and sexy-looking. "Cat?" he asked.

The woman looked up at the name, examining him with intelligent, puzzled, blue eyes, then looked away. "You know me, Father Sea Lord?" she asked, coolly.

"I'm not a father -- call me Daniel," he insisted.

"Daniel, then. You don't think too much of yourself, at least."

He say down beside her on the sand. "This might be a personal question, but have you lost an heir?"

"Why would you ask that?"

"Forgive me, but I've been asked to bring a message to someone. An agricultural worker named Cat who has lost an heir."

Cat's face twisted in a bitter grimace. "Well, yes, since you ask, I suppose you might say I have 'lost' an heir. One of your people, a leader of sea lords, sentenced her to death for nothing at all, and she fled into the sea to escape with a young man from the village. They've not returned. She was a good child who worked hard and had done nothing wrong."

Something clicked in Daniel's mind. "Kala was your heir," he said, more to himself than to her. "Gods, you think her dead."

"Is she not?" Cat sat up straighter and shifted closer to him.

Daniel glanced over at the odd note in the woman's voice. "No," he hastened to reassure her. "I've met her. She wants you to know that she's well and happy and does God's work all the time."

The woman leaned over and embraced him, hard, leaning her head against his chest for a long moment. He felt a tightening at his groin as she touched him. When she pulled away, Daniel saw that here were tears in her eyes, though she had made no sound of crying. "You're sure?" she asked. "You wouldn't lie to an old woman?"

"Never. Kala... well, she knew I'd be coming here and she asked me to let you know she's all right, and that --"

"Where was this?"

"I ... I can't tell you that. God would punish me," he invented, though it wasn't so much of an invention. A ship's captain at sea is like a god, and Captain Halloran made a particularly vengeful one. Daniel had seen him whip a man bloody for failing to completely tighten a single child-sized manacle; what he would do for a breach of the Slave Secrecy Acts did not bear thinking about.

Cat accepted this fairly calmly. "Did she say anything else?"

"Only that I should ask you about the third field."

Cat smiled for the first time, hesitantly, as though she were out of practice. "That's my Kala." She gestured at the people screwing on the beach. "Most of these would happily drown her if she came back, but she's still worried if they'll eat come harvest." She shook her head. "Well, tell her Mother Klara gave the field to Pilla. I doubt she'll make too much of a mess of it with Mother Klara watching her -- and me, too." She paused. "Tell her also that I love her but I'm sure she's doing good wherever she is. You'll remember this?"

He nodded. "Pilla, right?"

"Pilla. By the way, do you know who she's doing God's work with?"

"No. I only met her once."

"Once. Still, this penis was up my Kala, wasn't it?"

"Well -- Aye."

He realized as he said it that he was basically telling the woman that he had screwed her daughter, and he wondered for a moment if that was a good idea. He needn't have worried, though. Cat smiled to hear it. "Would you make an old woman happy and plough me with the same penis that ploughed my Kala?"

"I, uh ..." He hesitated, looked about at the beach full of screwing couples. Brin had found another cock, this one belonging to a naked islander with curly, brown hair, and was happily having her love-hole reamed out. At the sight, his own cock stiffened until it was as hard as a belaying pin. "I'd love to," he told Cat.

He reached out to put an arm around her shoulder, and Cat moved into it, seating herself on his lap with her legs on each side of his body, his cock brushing the neatly-trimmed, black fur around the entrance to her still-dribbling love-hole. Most of the liquid coming out now was her own, and it felt warm against his cock and legs. With a twist of her hips and a little help from her left hand, Cat forced the tip of his cock into herself and he moaned as she forced herself down it, squeezing and rubbing him delightfully, pressing her body intimately close to him. Her arms and legs were around his back and he could just feel the entrance to her womb with the tip of his cock. For a moment, she just sat and held him like this, her breasts, which sagged only slightly, poking his chest with hardened nipples, the walls of her passage shivering slightly around his cock. He tightened his arms around her back, holding her against him. "Mmm..." she muttered.

Presently, Kala's sponsor moved, and the movement teased his cock with an insistent pleasure. With her feet on the sand behind him, now, she rode him with her hips, driving her pleasant meat-sheath down around him with each fall, still holding him around the shoulders to keep her balance. Her juices dribbled down his shaft as she raised herself up, burning his cock with a pleasant fire.

Before he could approach a climax, she screamed and shivered in his arms, spasmodically forcing herself as far down his cock as she could go, her love-passage gripping and squeezing his cock as though it would take it off. She paused in her motion, insensible for a moment to his desire; and so, holding her body against him, he twisted sideways until she lay on her back on the sand with him on top. As she came to herself he was ramming his cock in and out of her, moaning as the pleasure filled it, and she moaned back, lifting her hips to force him farther into her. "God forgive me," she muttered between moans. "It hasn't been ... mmm ... this good since Kala ... Ooooo..."

Now, Daniel's cock felt as though it must split open with pleasure; and, with another thrust, it exploded in a climax that he felt throughout his body. He was aware of spraying his seed deep into Cat's soft love-passage, and of that same passage tightening spasmodically around him, and of someone screaming -- whether himself or her or both, he knew not -- but all else was a bliss that completely overwhelmed his senses.
