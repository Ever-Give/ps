Wow. This took longer than I expected to write and, now that I have it written down using actual words, instead of as a series of temporally-related images and concepts in my head, it looks way darker than I actually thought it would be. I hope not enough to put anybody off reading it.

The feast would last until the evening tide, and already, the sun was visibly declining. Kala wasn't sure how she felt about that; standing here, watching the other villagers amuse themselves was boring (not to mention hot and annoying), but she certainly wasn't looking forward to what came after. The pee drying on her legs had begun to itch annoyingly.

A markedly-pregnant Jadine glanced at Kala and looked away as she walked past carrying a cup of beer, preferring to watch Echila slowly lowering herself down onto the penis her current partner had produced from somewhere. All about, men and women were setting about God's work, giggling, moaning and exhorting each other to greater efforts, the remnants of the food still laid out on their plates in what was now the shadow of the Fence, as the great, stone wall was known. Watching the other villagers made Kala's vagina water. How long had it been since she'd been properly ploughed and seeded? This morning? It seemed like longer, although she knew it was probably the longest she'd ever gone without it since she became a woman.

Now, she wished she could have made it last somehow, though, even if that were possible, there had been no way for her to have known. Today had started out a perfectly normal day, except for the excitement of the impending Children's Day feast. Kala had been awake before dawn, and stepped out of the small, thatched hut she still shared with Cat to see the stars and the setting moon still reflected in the calm sea, and feel the still, cool night air. Down the beach, the metal pans the fishers used to dry ocean water into salt gleamed whitely in the moonlight. Kala squatted and let a stream of morning pee dampen the sand. In a few minutes, the first people would be awake and moving about, but for now, it was as though she owned the night. Marin would say that was blasphemy, but just at the moment, with the quiet of the night around her like a child-herd's arms and her pee trickling languidly out of her bladder, tickling her vagina-lips pleasantly, she didn't care.

She wasn't surprised when she heard slight foot-steps brushing the sand beside her. Temas had begun to make a habit of finding her somewhere for an early start on God's work -- a habit she encouraged as much as possible. He sat down beside her, and she could feel watching her, though she didn't look at him at first. A companionable silence remained between them. Kala's pee slowly trickled to a halt, but she didn't move. Finally, still not breaking the silence, she reached over and kissed him on the face. She felt his hard penis with one hand as she used the other to push him backward so that he was lying on his back on the sand.

By the time they'd finished with each other, the sun was beginning to show red on the west horizon, and Cat, her belly just starting to visibly swell, had come to the door of the hut and was watching them fondly. Now, Kala didn't know where Cat was. She'd vomited and run off, crying, after the pronouncement. Kala glanced around, not sure whether she wanted to see Temas or not, the wooden post uncomfortable against her back. She wished she could sit down. No, Temas appeared not to be anywhere about either. Marin and Hela had paired off and both looked to be glad of it, and beside them Gidau was sitting on the beach with a mug of beer, recovering from a session with Bie, who was continuing with the help of a straw-haired sea-lord.

Lopa was still in her place of honour near the Gate, her eyes puffy but no longer wet, refusing to take part in the festivities despite several offers. Kala realized that, at some point during the day, she had stopped feeling sorry for the plump orchard-tender. She genuinely wanted to feel sorry for her -- after all, the woman had just lost an heir -- but that was a bit difficult with the rope that she'd expected to have to endure for a few hours at most still chafing her wrists.

She had come running along with everyone else when she heard the woman screaming -- leaving what she had originally planned to be a quick inspection of the third field before the festivities began, though, somehow, the sun was fully up now -- and found a crowd gathering around Lopa, who was cradling her heir Yal in her lap under an apple tree and sobbing. The little girl had blood trickling down her forehead, and her eyes were a scary blankness. She didn't appear to be breathing. "What happened, Mother?" Kala asked Rena, who was standing beside her.

"The kid tripped and hit her head on a rock. It looks like her skull's cracked" Rena said, knowledgeably. "Freak accident."

"It's too bad," said Hela, who was standing on Kala's other side. "Of course, she'll replace Yal eventually, but you can't ever really replace an heir, can you?"

The crowd parted to allow Marin through. He examined the child, and shook his head. "I'm sorry, Lopa..." he began.

"What are you going to do about this, priest?" Lopa demanded.

The priest was nonplussed. "I don't know what I can do about it. The child is dead. Obviously you'll be entitled to sponsor another child at this or a future Children's Day. That's inadequate, I know, but..."

"I don't want another heir!" The woman stood, her still-firm breasts bouncing angrily, stains of blood on various parts of her skin. "I want you to punish the one who did this!"

"Are you suggesting that this was murder?" There was a collective gasp as the priest pronounced the word. "I understood that the child had simply tripped."

"What kind of a priest are you? Can you not see that God is punishing us..." Lopa looked about, and Kala jumped as the grieving sponsor pointed directly at her. "...for her sin!" She advanced on Kala as though she intended to kill her personally, though Marin tried gently to hold her back. "At every Gathering, you call for the newly pregnant to come forward, and she never comes. She's been a woman now for how many years? and never once has she come forward. I don't know what she's doing, but God does. It says it in The Word: 'The man who refuses to plough and the woman who refuses to be sown must be cast out lest My wrath descend equally on the people who harboured them.' She might as well have struck my Yal herself!"

Kala was horrified to see that several villagers were nodding in approval at these words. "But, Mother, I get myself seeded five times a day! More, some days!"

"It's true," said Cat, who had come to stand beside her heir. She put an arm protectively around Kala's waist. "My Kala's a good girl who goes out of her way to do God's work. I understand that you're grieving -- I can only imagine if God took Kala before me -- but--"

"Then she's done something to stop it taking root. We all know there are herbs that do such things! A sorceress!" Lopa turned on Marin. "Father, when the sea-lords come today, if you don't petition them to judge her, may God rip out my vagina if I don't see you stripped of office and Jase raised to your place! Your apprentice is a proper priest!"

"Lopa..." Marin tried to put an arm around Lopa's shoulder, but was rebuffed. "Of course if you make an accusation, I will follow up on it. It's my duty. But sorcery is a serious crime. The girl could be executed--"

"And quite right!"

"Only think on what you're doing."

"I have done!"

Kala felt a dread in the pit of her stomach as the priest turned toward her. She also felt like she might pee on herself in front of everyone. Still, trying to convince herself as much as everyone else, she forced herself to say, "It's all right Father. I-if it's the sea-lords, it'll be all right. Surely God's own messengers will know I didn't do anything wrong."

Now, Kala looked up as Temas came over to her post. He grinned at her in what she thought was meant to be a reassuring way, although it didn't quite work. "Temas," she said, "You're not ignoring me! Everyone else is. That's the worst part. That and watching everyone else seed each other." She thought she might be babbling, but, if she was, surely she was entitled. His penis was hard and sweat-beaded, and the sight made her want to scream with denied need. "It's making my vagina tingle horribly. Please, could you try to put your penis in it? I can't quite spread my legs enough, but--"

"I want to, so much," Temas whispered. "But, later. We have to be going." Even after she saw the knife in his hand, one like the goat-herds used to slaughter their animals, it took her a moment to figure out what he was doing.

Kala rubbed her wrists where the rope had chaffed them, as Temas knelt and started on the rope about her ankles. As ludicrous as it sounds, being tied to a post on the beach hadn't been so bad at first. She'd had a first-hand view of the other villagers laying out the feast, without having to do anything herself -- except, occasionally, to taste some food or other which Jadine and Beta, who thought the whole tied-to-a-post thing was a bit of a laugh, brought to her. Kala thought they were among the majority in that view, although a disturbing number of villagers did cast her dark looks in passing.

By the time the villagers began gathering for the feast, Kala was already beginning to feel a bit stiff from the straight-backed posture the post forced her to adopt, and also wishing she'd been allowed to pee before being tied up. She didn't think she could do it now without it running all down her legs.

Still, surely the sea-lords would be here soon. Q'ine, a grandmother with a head of pure-white hair who was the head of the child-herds, was leading her assistants and those of their charges who had previously seen five Children's Days (and who would therefore be six years old today) out of the nursery huts and into the feast area around the thick, wooden Gate.

Although a party led by Marin and Jase had been through the Gate earlier in the day to see that the beach beyond was clean and the wide, deep area of sea that the Fence hid was unblocked, the Fence was normally the limit beyond which nobody went. That was doubly true today. They would wait for the sea-lords to open the Gate and come through.

Q'ine gathered the six-year-olds in a group and Marin came forward to give the traditional sermon about the responsibilities and duties of a sponsor and an heir. "Let any man who is without an heir and would have one of these boys for his heir come forward," he concluded. "Let any woman who is without an heir and would have one of these girls for her heir come forward." A few came. Kala was glad to see Mara being led out of the group by Giara, who had birthed her second only a few weeks ago and was thus entitled. They stood outside the circle with Giara's hands on her new heir's shoulders, watching as other children were selected. Most, if not all, of the choices had been made in advance, but the ceremony had to be respected. A few wiped away a tear as they watched some favourite who they could neither sponsor themselves nor find a sponsor for remain standing in the offering group, but overall, and in spite of Lopa's loss, it was a happy moment.

The Gate opened. The villagers turned and knelt, save for the unsponsored children, Kala (whose post made that difficult) and Marin. The latter stepped forward. "We welcome you in the name of God," he said, gesturing toward the children, "and His harvest is ready and gathered for you."

"What are you doing?" Kala whispered as Temas stood up again, leaving the knife and the sliced-through ankle-rope on the sand in front of her. She didn't want to look around, lest she see someone pointing at them. "Will they not punish you, too?"

"Not if they can't find either of us. Come on!" He took her hand, and she followed him, the two of them heading for the water as quickly as they could.

The sea-lords were an odd-looking people, their bodies mostly covered in various unnatural colours ranging from tans and beiges similar to normal skin, to bright greens and blues to rival a parrot's plumage. Though all evidently male, they appeared at first glance to lack penises; however, Kala knew from past experience that the organs were merely hidden.

It was traditional for women who had not yet borne children to have first chance to ask the sea-lords for their seed, and for the past several years Kala had done so, always finding them quite ready to produce penises that worked exactly the same as those she was used to from holes in what, up close, appeared to be a decorative skin-covering rather than their actual skin; for they would often end up removing it entirely as the feast went on. Kala couldn't imagine what the purpose of such a thing could be, but she wasn't alone in the belief that the sea-lords and their semi-divine agricultural equipment were the highlight of any Children's Day.

This year, the first of the sea-lords through the Gate was a tall man with a dark, lined face and a beard as much white as it was brown. He appeared to be the leader of the sea-lords, for, after thanking Marin and the villagers quickly but politely for the offering, he merely gestured to three of the score or so of men who had come behind him and they quickly and efficiently led the unsponsored children away through the Gate to whatever conveyance the sea-lords used. When Hoal, the head of the fishers, stepped forward and humbly prayed that his workers be granted a few new fishing lines to replace ones that had worn out, the leader nodded and another of the men followed his comrades.

Then, Marin the priest stood up again. "Father, er, Sea-Lord," he said, "We beg your assistance in the disposition of justice. A charge has been levelled against one of our number, and we--"

"Get on with it," the sea-lord leader interrupted. He gestured to Kala (who was, after all, the only person present who was tied to a post). "What's she done, then?"

"She's a sorceress!" Lopa yelled. Marin glared at her, but she continued, anyway. "She refuses to bear children!"

"Twaddle," said Cat. "My Kala gets herself seeded right regular. If she's not--"

The sea-lord leader held up a hand. "How many children has she borne?" he asked Marin.

"Well, none, Father, but..."

"At her age? Kill her after the feast. Anything else?"

It took Kala a moment to realize what had just happened, and another, after that, to realize that she was peeing down her own legs. Four sea-lords came back through the gate, one carrying a handful of fishing lines.

The seawater washed the now-dried pee from Kala's legs, and she let some more out as she swam. Her nipples hardened even more than they already were. It felt nice and warm as she followed Temas away from the beach. They were both good swimmers, and watching the muscles flex in his bottom, which was just below the surface of the water as he swam, was distracting, but still... "Where are we going?" she called to him. "You know there's no other land."

"I'm not sure of that. Have you never looked out at the horizon on a clear day? It sure looks like there's something out there."

"An illusion to tempt the faithless!"

"You've been listening to Father Marin. Still, we'd never swim there in any case. I'm headed somewhere closer."

She tore her eyes away from the curve of his buttocks, trying to make her vagina tingle less so that she could swim straight; they were actually rounding the end of the Fence, which, at high tide, was nearly 30 yards from the shore. "The sea-lords plan to carry the children away in something," Temas called to her, "and, wherever they're going, I figure it's better than here."

Kala stopped and trod water, staring at him. "You're mad!"

He must have heard her voice dropping behind, for he turned and swam back. "What's mad is going back and letting them kill you. Mayhap I'm selfish, but I'd rather end up anywhere else or nowhere with you, than back there with you dead." He kissed her face, then put an arm around her and guided her to the end of the wall. The seaward end was a jagged ruin of broken rock, but covered with a thick layer of aquatic moss that made for a convenient and pleasant place to stand a couple of feet below the surface of the water. Here, they were out of sight of the feast area. "And, look."

She looked where he was pointing, then stared. It had to be the sea-lords' conveyance, for she'd never seen anything so unworldly. The bottom of it, which sat on the water somehow, was a structure of what looked like wood, but shiny and curved into a beautiful, almost organic shape, almost like a seabird's breast, but big enough to cover two of the village's largest fields. Above, an intricate web of rope and more wood held in place giant, delicate-looking, cloud-grey bits of some material similar, she thought, to the sea-lords' skin-coverings, as though the giant bird were to fly with clouds instead of wings.

"There are openings near the bottom," Temas told her excitedly, hugging her in the water so that his penis rubbed against her belly, tantalizingly close to her vagina-opening. "We can get inside and hide. And nobody from the village will be able to find us!"

"You were serious when you said you'd rather be with me, lost?"

"Yes! I know one woman is supposed to be the same as another but ... you're not. You're different."

She kissed him on the mouth. "So are you. All right, let's go. I think we'll end up dead, but it's the same if we go back." He started to pull away, but she held onto him. "Wait! I don't think you understand how crazy I'm going from watching the others work. I need your penis now, or I'm not going anywhere."

He grinned. "Me, too. I thought we'd wait 'till we were inside, but, since you insist..." He forced his penis inside her and she squealed with long-denied pleasure. This morning had been slow and languid, as they took time to relish every moment of it; now, in the sea, it was fast and almost violent, she wrapping her legs around him and squeezing, as though she would shove his entire body into her burning vagina, he pressing her backward against the moss-covered rocks as though he would stab a way through her.

They kissed again, their tongues twining together, and her already-hard nipples rubbed against his chest, the sensation complimenting the pleasure his penis was ramming into her, as though her entire torso were a vagina. "Harder!" she gasped. "Oh, God, I'll..."

"Me, too!" His hands were on her buttocks and he pulled, squeezing himself into her as she felt his penis jerk inside her, his seed spraying into her. The sensation pushed her over the edge, the pleasure an explosion inside her, her legs involuntarily squeezing him tighter than she thought was possible, and both screamed so loudly that they would later wonder how the revellers on shore had failed to hear them. Some of his seed sprayed out from between them into the sea water.

They were still for a moment after they were spent, each clasping the other to his body, his penis still inside her. Finally, reluctantly, they separated enough to swim. "Somewhere, sometime, we have to do that again," he said.

"Absolutely. Of course, you realize, we could be in hiding for a while, but later..."
