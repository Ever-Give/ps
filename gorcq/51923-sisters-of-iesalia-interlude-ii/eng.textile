It came to me as I sat down to write the fifth chapter of Keala's story, that this story must be told first. Why this is, I don't know; it bears no relation to Keala, being to her a remote history. It is also highly disgusting. I recommend that you not read it -- or, at least, that you skip the beginning, as the end has the more interesting content. --Gorcq

Observations of the Affairs of Gods by Sister Theria of the Order of Iesalia (325-348 C.G.)

Translated and with an introduction by Gilma, Head Sister at the Temple to Iesalia at Hesen River (739-785 C.G.)

Introduction

The Ram�nian order was, by all accounts, a proper gang of bullies; their God, perhaps, no less so. They quickly gained power among the ignorant farmers of those times after it became clear that those who refused to bow down before Ram�n's image would find their crops burnt just before the harvest. (It is unclear whether this was the work of the God or bands of Priests running around after dark.) Those who openly defied the god were usually slain publicly, their blood given to Ram�n as a sacrifice.

This same order imposed a calendar originally called Caella Ram�na (C.R.) in High Lanthian, meaning Ram�n's Years. Imposed in 30 C.R. (equivalent to 30 C.G.), this calendar was said to be based at the year when Ram�n appeared to his first followers on a stump, and insisted upon 273 days in a year. Modern astronomical studies suggest that there are 284 days to a solar year. This perhaps explains why, in 36 C.R., there were questions even among the ignorant farmers about the fact that Ram�nia, then the first month of the year which had originally occurred in early summer, was now occurring in midwinter. The Head Ram�nian Priest fasted for a week (or, according to some accounts, partied for a week with his brother Priests and an astonishingly large number of prostitutes), then declared that Ram�n had informed him that the months were meant to move around cyclically, and anyone who didn't like it should get ready for a hard winter. This is the origin of our modern calendar system.

This order ruled in all but name until 343 C.G., when the Head Sister of the Order of Iesalia, the Head Brother of the Order of Geralio and the High Priest of Rac�lpe all received visions at about the same time. Each claimed to have seen all three deities together commanding the three orders to join together against Ram�n's Priests. They did so, and killed or drove into hiding every Priest of Ram�n. Thereafter, the worship of this god was made illegal and the calendar, though kept the same structurally, was changed in name to honour Geralio as it does today.

In the first moments of this battle, Sister Theria, the youngest of the Order of Iesalia, was struck by a rock which, though it did her no lasting damage, kept her unconscious long enough to miss all of the fighting. Upon awakening the following day, Theria begged her sisters to quickly bring her pen and ink and parchment, saying that she had promised the Mistress her-self to make an account of what she had seen while with the Gods. Following is this account, as best I can render it into modern speech.

I did not feel the rock, or if I did, I forgot it immediately. I found my-self in a wooded place, standing beside two men and a woman, who were carefully watching a nearby path, as hunters do who expect their game to come soon. The men held weapons of types I am not familiar with, though, of course, as a Sister, I should know nothing of this. The woman turned to me, and saw me, as none other in that place ever appeared to do. She was the Mistress, and I bowed to her, and begged her forgiveness for intruding, but, "You are summoned here, and are therefore welcome," she said, and desired me to give a full account of all I saw when I should return to my-self, which I readily promised. Her companions, she said, were Geralio and Rac�lpe, and, though I cannot think where I have seen their images before, I seemed to recognize them.

The three were naked, and I blushed as I realized this; but the Mistress told me that, as Gods are not men but merely look like them to those who are not equipped to see them as they are, so the sight of them was not a violation of my vows, so long as I should not make love to them; which, as they seemed unable to see me, appeared unlikely in the extreme. Though I must confess that my woman's flower drooled beneath my garment at sight of their manly attributes, no matter how much I reminded my-self that they were unreal.

A time passed, the length of which I cannot account for; there being, perhaps, no time in that place. Thereafter came Ram�n along the path; him I recognized, for how often have I seen his likeness, even in our very dormitory? At his coming, the other three Gods tensed their bodies expectantly, and as it seemed he would pass by our place of concealment, Geralio and Rac�lpe leapt from hiding and, suddenly grabbing his arms, forced him to lie down upon the path, threatening him with their weapons until he complied. Iesalia then came upon him and, working methodically with a small knife I had not seen before, cut his living body into pieces; taking care that his stalk and his crab-apples should comprise three separate pieces, and that the number of the pieces should be exactly two hundred and seventy three.

Of these, each Deity took ninety-one, including one part of his generative organs; and the two Gods took separate ways, leaving me alone with the Mistress. "They go to bury him in many secret places, Geralio in Hell and Rac�lpe among the Heavens," she said. I followed her for what seemed like many days while she did the same upon the Earth; and in that time we saw no human, God or demon. Thereafter, she turned to me, covered in the blood of Rac�lpe, and desired me to help her to wash.

I looked and saw that we were in a dry place, with no source of water visible, and, hesitantly, I said as much. "And yet, there is," she replied, "and it is here." Whereat she touched my womanhood with one finger, which touch made my entire body to shiver with pleasure, and knelt before me. I tried at first to prevent this, as I thought it unseemly; but when I realized what she meant I removed my garment and attempted, at first with little success, to comply. Gradually I managed to relax my body enough to spray her with my own water, the warmth of which made the Mistress sigh with pleasure; and, though I had been unaware, at first, that my bladder was full, I soon felt as though I released after holding on for days, and there was quite enough to completely cleanse the Goddess of blood.

Iesalia, still wet from her odd bath, raised her-self and, before I knew what was happening, licked the remaining drops of my water from my pubic hairs and from my sex it-self, and the touch of her tongue was as a bolt of lightning through my body. She made me to lie down upon the sands of that place, dry as bone except where my own water had fallen, and continued these ministrations, which, though embarrassed to be pleasured by the Mistress, I accepted with no little happiness; and when she turned her-self to lie across me, so that her own sex should be within reach of my mouth as mine was to hers, I touched it as I would one of my Sisters, and with my lips and tongue and fingers, did my humble best to bring pleasure to her. And, though she knew better than I, or any mortal woman I have had the pleasure to meet in such a manner, what she was about, still I may say that, to judge by the moans that I felt more through my sex than my ears, I must have done her some good.

My own pleasure being already beyond all mortal ability, it is small wonder that I soon collapsed, screaming from pleasure. It is, perhaps, more of a wonder that, when I next recall, the Mistress, breathing heavily but having already shifted her-self to lie beside me with her head near mine, said, "Thank you, child. That was amazing," giving all appearance of being as satiated as I. Thereafter, she informed me that it was time for me to go home.

Then I begged the mistress to allow me to first ask of her one question; and when she gave her consent, I continued: "Is Ram�n dead?"

She replied: "No, not as a mortal would be. If some fool were to find all of his parts and put him together, he would spring up alive, and make more trouble in the Heavens and upon the Earth."

Then we said our good-byes, and I awakened in the care of my pious and very worried Sisters.

Translator's Notes:

1. Within a month after this account was written, Sister Theria is said to have awakened early in the morning, screaming loudly. Her Sisters, many of whom at that time slept in a single, large dormitory, and who would later argue amongst themselves as to whether her screams were of pleasure or pain, could only elicit from Sister Theria that the Mistress had visited her in dream and suggested some improvements for the phrasing in her writing. She would later experience quite a few such visions of the Mistress, and when she died in her sleep at the age of 23, her Sisters, though devastated, wrote that Iesalia must have loved Sister Theria so much as to be unable to wait for her to expire naturally, but had taken her prematurely to live in the Heavens with the Goddess.

2. There exists a rumour to the effect that the Goddess took Ram�n's penis, and, not hiding it as she did the other pieces, kept it for herself for her own reasons; until, 273 years later, her two co-horts in the assassination convinced her to bury it properly. I have even heard it said that Sister Theria wrote of this herself; but as I cannot find any such reference in any of her work, and as, indeed, the first verifiable occurrence of the tale was written late in the last century with no verifiable source for the information, I must conclude that it has no basis in fact.
