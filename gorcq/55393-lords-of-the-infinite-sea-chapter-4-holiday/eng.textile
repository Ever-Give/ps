It is possible that I might, sometime yesterday, have made a post elsewhere on this site that gives a rather dismal impression of my progress in writing the fourth chapter of this story. You would be well advised to ignore such a post. Here is the fourth chapter with no holes that I can see, although it may be a bit dark. I hope that is not a disappointment; although I cannot imagine how any thinking person could have read the first three chapters and expected this one to be comedic.

I realize that it has been near to two months since the last chapter, so in case you have not read the beginning or require a refresher, here are links to the previous chapters.

Chapter 1: The Gathering

Chapter 2: Children's Day

Chapter 3: An Unexpected Friend

###

Kala sighed almost regretfully as she raised herself off the strange young man's softening penis, her knees still a little weak from the orgasm she'd just had, his seed dribbling down the inside of her right thigh. "God, that was good," she told him. She glanced around South Market Square and smiled at the sheer number of people who'd turned out, many amusing themselves in pairs or groups, some resting or loafing about, a few just watching from the edges as though trying to decide whether to join in or not. Most were naked, and, while the majority had arrived that way, a small pile of clothing and the occasional shirt or cap still on a body testified to a growing number of free folk taking part in the event -- evidence that not everyone regarded them with hostility. Jormund the Impressor looked down at them -- unwillingly, as Kala imagined -- from his giant plinth, the high, summer sun casting a puddle of shadow at its base.

Having been somewhat worried that the thing would fail due to sheer lack of interest, Kala was relieved; she could only hope the other areas of the city were this idle. She took a moment to wander about and look on her fellow slaves. They were genuinely her fellows now, George Farthon having been happy to sell her and Temas (to his own profit) after Elia had introduced them with what Kala had thought to be a very silly story about two farm slaves whose master had unfortunately died without heirs. "You're sure you want to do this?" she'd asked, as the three of them approached Master George's house to put this plan into effect. It was a month or so after their arrival.

Kala glanced at her childhood friend's face, still a mess of bruises and minor cuts. "I'm sure," she said. "Temas?"

He nodded. "Otherwise, how are we going to eat without putting you at risk of being punished again?" Neither had realized that George might consider the food Elia had been bringing them at the warehouse to be stolen, until Elia showed up empty-handed and injured.

"Besides," added Kala, "Its boring having nothing to do all day. Just, wait a moment." She squatted and peed a large puddle on the cobblestones. Then, they went inside. By the following afternoon, Temas had been purchased by a butcher wanting an assistant; and Kala, her agricultural experience having been evident, by a bearded gentleman named Hiram Jessup who ran a service sending slaves to cultivate the gardens of rich folks too lazy to do it themselves.

That had been just about a year ago; now, she wandered toward the low, stone building where slaves to be sold were kept, hoping to get a drink of water from one of the spouts inside. She waved when she saw Elia, her face mostly healed now, being ploughed enthusiastically by a young man in a sailor's rough canvas shirt, her breasts bouncing in time to their mutual gasping, her buttocks being pounded against the paving stones in what looked like a quite uncomfortable manner; although, if so, Elia appeared not to notice.

"What I don't understand," Kala had said to Elia one day the previous year, "is how it can be that God favours the slavers." The two of them were on hands and knees in the walled garden at the back of the Farthon house. Since Mrs Farthon had contracted with Hiram Jessup to take care of her garden, the girls had taken advantage to occasionally spend some time together. Elia was supposed to be in the master's office cataloguing his papers while he was out meeting his business partners for coffee, but he wouldn't notice if she spent an hour or three on the project; it was never-ending.

"What do you mean?" Elia asked.

Kala had lost track of how the conversation had migrated to theology from comparisons of the men they had seen in terms of attractiveness, but it was a subject she'd done some thinking about. "God orders us to do His work, to make babies, just so the slavers can take them here and sell them. It seems odd." She liked working next to Elia in the garden; it reminded her of when they were children together, put to work by Mother Klara.

Elia yanked a weed out of the soil, then sat back and looked at her friend. "I keep forgetting you haven't been here all your life," she said. "You don't know about Jormund the Impressor."

"The fellow on the post at the South Market Square?"

"A fitting place for him. Master George has a copy of his memoir in the library. He's known for setting up fifteen islands like ours specifically to supply the slavers."

"There are more besides our own?"

"Certainly. Today, I think there are 75, all set up according to Jormund's instructions. You see, they take new-born babies and raise them on the islands, calling themselves God's messengers and teaching the babies a religion he made up out of his head."

"He made God up?"

Elia smiled cynically. "In his memoir, he wrote something like, 'There is nothing quite like religion to make folk act against their own best interest.'"

Since then, Kala had found it nigh impossible to pray to God. She had not given up on fornication (a term she'd learned since she'd been in Jurhold), but now she did it because she enjoyed it, and only when she wanted it. She glanced around the slave market and saw Temas sitting with a young woman she recognized as Tania, the freeborn daughter of Lord Granville. Tania's dress was pulled up to her thighs and Temas was massaging something under it with his right hand, his left touching his own hardened penis. Despite her own recent session with the young man, the sight made Kala's vagina water, imagining how happy the young heiress would be feeling in a few minutes. And she couldn't help thinking, though it shocked her that she could be so cynical, that it wouldn't hurt to have a Granville on their side at the end of a day like this.

She was actually supposed to be weeding Lady Granville's garden right now and Master Hiram would be annoyed when he found out; but it had been her idea to stop working, and one she'd worked hard to bring to reality. Well, mostly her idea. She and Temas had come up with it one night a few days after her theological conversation with Elia. Unable to see each other much during the day, they had taken to meeting in the evening whenever they could sneak away. That night, they were lying on a pile of slightly mouldy straw that had been used to cushion 25 crates of Geleesian pottery, now unpacked and off for sale in various parts of town.

Their coupling had been frantic but now, sweat-covered and with various other fluids dripping from their generative organs, they were calmly enjoying each other's proximity, and Kala told him how Master Hiram had beaten Meg, another gardening slave, for being late back from Mr Golon's garden. "It's bad," he mused, almost as much to himself as to her. "Slaves run this town. It would fall apart without them. But, nobody does anything when a man mistreats them. Today my master told a carter off for beating his donkey. But, did any of them look twice when Elia was wandering around with her face all bruised and cut up?"

There was silence for a moment, except for the sounds of rats in the warehouse walls and ships bumping against each other outside. "We do run this town," Kala muttered, so quietly that Temas had to ask her what she'd said. "We do run this town," she repeated. "And what if we stopped? Took the day off? All of us? What would they do? They couldn't just beat everyone."

"Well..."

"They'd have to at least think about what they were doing."

"Well, the problem is getting everyone to slack off at once."

"True." She snuggled up against him and they didn't talk about it again that evening. But the idea kept coming back to her.

In South Market Square, Kala reluctantly glanced away from Temas and Tania as she felt a touch on her shoulder. She turned to see Rendolph, a middle-aged cooking slave from the Siliths' household and one of the earliest believers in Kala's plan, grinning at her. His curly, brown hair, shot with grey, was damp with sweat and his penis, though soft, was slowly returning to hardness. "It's working!" he crowed. "There are at least 100 slaves here. Larruy just ran over and told me he counted 146 slaves in the North Market alone, and Gopa says that the police have over 10,000 complaints filed by masters who want their slaves forced back to work -- and that's just the ones in Park Street!" He had named the location of the main Jurhold police headquarters. Suddenly, he grabbed her and hugged her, pressing her nipples pleasantly against his cook-fire-tanned chest.

She smiled back, though cautiously. "That's great news, Rend, but they still haven't agreed to anything." His penis, squeezed against her belly, was rapidly growing harder, and she was just considering asking him to put it in her -- she was sure he'd be delighted to -- when she heard a commotion behind her.

The day after her talk with Temas, Kala and Meg were planting nursery flowers in Lady Silith's garden, Meg's back covered in painful whip-marks that must have made it quite painful to bend over, although the girl made no complaint. Kala paused, squatting with her vagina next to a purple peony to pee on the soft earth and watched the other girl for a while. "Meg," she said at last, uttering for the first time the words that, with only minor alterations, she would later repeat to hundreds of other slaves, "if you thought you had a way to change the world, to stop slaves being beaten -- all slaves -- but you needed everyone to just stop working, what would you do?"

"Well, I'd talk to them, explain, ask for their help."

"So would I. That's why I'm talking to you now. Look, slaves run this town..." She outlined the concept in a few sentences.

Meg hesitated. "But, if not enough slaves showed up, they'd just --"

Kala nodded. "That's why we have to make sure we have enough before anyone else knows about it." Meg still looked unconvinced. "Look, if you don't want to help, I understand --"

"I'll help you." Both girls jumped. "Sorry," said Rendolph, who was standing behind them, "I didn't mean to scare you. But I want to help. I like your idea."

Meg hugged Kala. "Me, too," she said, "only, let's be careful!"

The next few months were spent trying to spread the word to as many slaves as possible without exposing themselves. Meetings after dusk for slaves who could slip away from their homes, whispered talks with slaves at the houses where she worked, and above all oaths of secrecy had led to today's public event. And now, with a stranger's seed drying on her legs and her nipples and vagina tingling from her close contact with Rendolph, Kala turned and saw perhaps a score of men marching into the square. It took her a moment to fully apprehend what she was seeing, but the swords and muskets spoke for themselves. Some of the slaves had taken fright and run, and Kala couldn't blame them. A few others were too busy fornicating to notice what was going on. But a surprising and gratifying number of slaves, with a few freemen and -women among them, were just waiting to see what the soldiers would do.

At a shouted order, the men formed into several ranks of khaki pants and waited as a soldier with a bigger hat than the others stepped forward. He was surprisingly young to be in command; the hair that escaped from under his hat was solid black. "I'm Colonel Ron Tabermann of His Excellency's Royal Army!" he called out. "Who's in charge, here?"

There was silence. For just a second, Kala considered not responding. Then, she took a closer look at the colonel's face, which was tired and set, like a man doing an unpleasant chore. Kala stepped forward. "I'm Kala," she said. "I suppose I'm in charge, if anyone is."

"Kala!" yelled Temas, leaving the Granville girl and stepping forward. Elia, her bottom an angry red but her face and vagina a healthy pink, grasped his arm and, when he stopped to look at her, stood on tiptoe to whisper in his ear. He nodded and made no more attempt to get to Kala, but still watched the colonel suspiciously -- as everyone else in the square was doing.

Colonel Ron looked down at Kala, and frowned. "I haven't time for games, girl." Still, she saw his pants bulge at his crotch as he looked her up and down. She relaxed, knowing that she really was in charge.

"Of course not," said Kala, moving closer to him. "You've got a job to do. A bad job, but a job nonetheless." She stepped up close to him. "What if you could do a better job, what if you could change the world, and all you had to do was fornicate in a public place?" Her hand on his crotch made it clear with whom she expected him to fornicate. He hesitated, and she leaned close to him, her voice dropping. "Do you want to be the man who killed a group of naked, unarmed slaves trying to make a better life for themselves, or the visionary who saw that the world was changing and showed his men and the government the right way to handle it?"

The colonel glanced about at the slaves and his own men, and then down at Kala who was already unbuttoning his pants to get at his hidden penis. He wavered for a moment more, but when Kala's index finger brushed the shaft of his penis, she felt it jerk and he suddenly turned back to his men. "At ease! Chester, Halloran, get word to Captain Ler and Captain Jeshua that orders have changed. Everyone else, dismissed." Two men ran away in opposite directions; the rest looked about them in confusion.

Kala had by now undone all the buttons on his trousers along with his belt, causing them to fall down around his ankles, his sword clattering on the flagstones; a shiver went through her body and her vagina watered at the sight of his large penis. His left hand was gingerly tracing the outline of her breast. Over his shoulder, she saw Elia putting her arm around the back of a handsome, brown haired soldier with a wide chest while talking to him quietly and Tania Granville shyly pressing another's hand against her dress, over her left breast. More women, mostly naked, were stepping forward to follow their example. Then Ron lifted her slightly off the ground and kissed her, and she forgot about the others, only feeling his tongue caressing her own, her breasts tingling against his rough, cotton shirt and the shaft of his penis touching the lips of her vagina, the hard warmth tantalizing.

Ron set her down and unbuttoned his shirt so quickly he tore one of the button holes, dropping it on top of his trousers, kicking his sword out of the way. He sat down, using the garments as a cushion against the hard flagstones. Where the clothing had covered him, his skin was a markedly lighter colour than his hands and face, and his penis practically white, but it stuck up hard and a dribble of thin, watery seed had appeared at the tip. "Why don't you come sit on my lap?" he asked.

Kala needed no second invitation. Straddling his legs, she squatted down and carefully impaled herself on his long-hidden manhood. "O, God!" she cried out as she felt it penetrate her, filling up and stretching her vagina. She wrapped her arms and legs about his torso, pulling herself close, forcing him as far into her as he would go. The tip barely kissed the bottom of her vagina, the gate to what Father Marin would have called God's field, and her body shuddered at the contact, her vagina squeezing him hard. With her face now next to his ear, added, quietly, "With a weapon like that, I'm glad you're on our side."

"Maybe I'm not," he returned, breathing heavily. "I did just stab you." His hat had fallen off when she gripped him, and he made no attempt to capture it as it rolled away. Instead, he pulled back and Kala worked with him, almost reluctantly, setting her feet on the ground so as to pull herself almost completely off his penis, before dropping down again.

As she felt again the light contact of his tip against her inmost gate, she screamed, her vagina exploding, her body shaking and gripping him in every way she could. It was a minor climax of the sort that only made her want more contact, more rubbing, more climaxes, more of everything that made fornication a joy.

"My," said Ron, looking down at her face, "you certainly --" He stopped talking as she kissed him again and began to ride him fast, he forcing himself fully into her with his hips each time they came together, her vagina burning hot and its juices dribbling down his shaft and matting the curly, black hairs that covered its hilt.

"Gods," he gasped into her ear, "if we ... continue like this ... I'll ..."

"Do it!" she yelled. "Do it, do it, do it oooooo." The last was a moan of pleasure as she felt his seed drench her inmost parts, spraying hard as she climaxed again, squeezing him with arms and legs as another climax affected her entire body.

For just a moment, or possibly longer, there was nothing in the world save this climax; when she came slightly back to herself she found that his penis had only barely softened and was rapidly returning to full readiness under the influence of the warmth and softness of her vagina, his seed dribbling out of her down his shaft. Wanting more, she began again to ride him, but he lifted himself off the ground and carefully deposited her buttocks on top of his clothes so that he was on top. She squirmed against him until he began to plough her, all but tearing her insides in their mutual impatience.

A third time, she felt the pleasure of their contact building in her vagina, her nipples rubbing his chest each time they came together and sending hot sparks down her body. His penis was now, if anything, harder than before, and she felt that little, inside touch of the tip every time, lifting her up, pushing her higher.

Just as she began to wonder, in a distracted and not very worried way, whether he might not have broken her vagina such that she could only feel more and more pleasure without ever reaching the climax, the explosion came again, this time as though her entire body was a vagina.

For another moment, a longer one this time she thought, there was nothing outside the climax, outside her vagina that was her body. She thought she might be screaming, and she felt Ron's penis jerk inside her, hard, as it gave her insides a second spraying, but she knew nothing else.

When she came to herself, it was with a weight on her body, pressing her against the flagstones and the cushion of the colonel's clothes. "Are you all right?" asked a familiar voice. Temas.
