Chapter 2: In which Natalie's friend Oliver is examined more Closely; a friendly Argument occurs regarding the Desirability of the Weather; some Description of campus Life during the Rain is Offered; masturbation Requires organization; a slight misunderstanding Occurs, due largely to the ambient Darkness; and excessive Proximity causes discomfort.

Oliver's hair clung wetly to his head as he walked toward the dormitory building. Five weeks of rain, and he was already wished it would stop. Well, he didn't really want the full sun back; mainly, he was tired of the constant, grey, cloud-filtered sunlight that was the world in the rain. It almost hurt his eyes. He knew from experience that, when the sun properly came back, he'd have lost whatever natural protection he had against it, and it would burn him good. He supposed he wished the weather were less consistent.

He and Natalie had agreed to disagree on this subject. He'd tried to explain to her why he seemed less than thrilled with the change of seasons one morning last week while they were walking to Professor Erd's Entomic Anatomy class. Natalie had applied soap to her body before they left the dormitory building and was now rubbing her hands through her hair to ensure that the rain washed all of it out. "You'd have it rain less?" she asked.

"Well, less constantly, anyway."

"Which means less rain over the course of the season."

"I guess--"

"In favour of more hot, dry days when dust clings to your body and you feel constantly filthy." She had finished with her hair, now, and let it hang wetly about her head.

"Well, that doesn't happen immediately after the rain's over."

She shook her head. "I still don't get it. If it was up to me, it would rain all year long. Of course, you farmers would have trouble with that, but I'd feel nice and clean all the time. You know, I can't even take a pee outside in the dry season without getting it all over me. Now, I can do it while walking, and it just washes away!"

Oliver glanced over. He wasn't sure, but he thought the rainwater on her legs was slightly yellow.

Now, Oliver's sandals made a harder sound as he crossed from the muddy dirt path to the cobblestones of a square. White-haired Professor Bligh and his elderly, white dog walked by, and Oliver greeted them. The dog's long, wet fur hanging limply off his face made him appear disgruntled -- that and the handle of his master's briefcase, which he carried in his mouth. Nearby, a group of students sitting on a bench in front of the biology building were quizzing each other on the conjugations of Galtian verbs. There were people doing something everywhere.

The main thing that had surprised when he first came to Toron University was the complete lack of privacy. Not that he needed it often. Still, at home on his parents' farm there were always places he could go and expect not to have people around -- behind the barn in the middle of the day, for example, or under a certain bridge he had passed on his way home from the secondary school in Gramon, the nearest town. He'd usually gone to one of these places a few times a week ever since Mother had found him, in his 13th year, playing with his manhood on the couch in the living room. He hadn't known about that until later, because she quickly left the room and ordered Father to go talk to him.

"Son," his father had said concisely, "there's really only one thing the human body wants to do naturally that oughtn't to be done in company. You're doing it now."

At university, he'd found that, no matter where he went, there was a high likelihood someone would come along on some business or other.

Oliver approached the dormitory building. Three students sitting on the front steps discussing Springdale's Physical Assertions moved slightly to let him pass, without stopping their conversation. It was here that he'd seen Natalie when she evidently didn't want to be seen.

It had taken him until the rain started to figure out how to solve the privacy problem, though, in hindsight, it seemed quite simple. The rain had woken him in the middle of the night from a very embarrassing dream involving Natalie and the handle of a reaping hook which made him glad she couldn't see his dreams. Lying there in the dark, his penis hard and almost throbbing, he wondered for a moment how he would get back to sleep before it occurred to him that this was the perfect opportunity to take care of it. If there were ever a time when he could find a place to go alone, this would be it.

Oliver got up and quietly slipped downstairs. It was only as he reached the mud room and saw that the door was open that it occurred to him that he might not be the only one out of bed. It wasn't until he stepped outside and saw her that he realized this other person was Natalie.

Natalie was standing on the path before the steps, her back to him. The cloud-filtered moon gave the only light, but it seemed to him that her back was slightly arched and both hands were in the vicinity of her crotch. He heard a quiet sigh escape her, and it occurred to him that she must be out for the same reason as him.

He only realized after a moment that he was staring at her. He ought to say something, so she'd know she wasn't alone. "Oh, I'm not bothering you, am I?" he asked, and berated himself mentally the next moment for saying something so stupid.

Natalie spun around, and, just for a moment Oliver thought he saw something spray out of her lower mouth. He thought he'd heard somewhere that girls could do that in their pleasure. "Uh, no," she said, quite nervously, "I, uh, just came out to feel the rain."

"It feels good," said Oliver, not wanting to embarrass her any more. Then, realizing what that sounded like, he quickly added, "The rain, I mean." But Natalie brusquely told him she was going back to bed, and did so. Oliver found a place a bit more out-of-the-way behind the biology building (he thought it was fitting) to take care of his own sex, imagining what he might have seen had he arrived a minute earlier.

Now, Oliver shook himself, water cascading from his hair and beards. The mat on the floor of the dormitory building's mud room absorbed much of it. He walked through the refectory, which had been taken over for an activity involving quite a lot of shouting by a number of students including Jaime and Cara, who he knew because they had beds near his own upstairs. Something political, maybe? Upstairs, the same flat, grey light pervaded the dormitory through the high windows. In the middle of the day, many of the beds were empty.

A few students were resting, but most students in the dormitory were doing some sort of work. Elinor, a slightly pudgy girl with rather puffy female lips that she tried unsuccessfully to hide in a thick brown beard, was sitting cross-legged on her bed, carefully re-waxing her rucksack to keep its content dry when she went out. James and three students Oliver knew only by sight had papers strewn across one of their beds, along with pens, ink, sand and a small lap-desk, and were arguing about the wording of some group essay. "He won't notice it's not there!" the brown-haired girl was insisting as Oliver walked past.

"Oh, right, he won't notice that the main point of the essay topic has been omitted!" James retorted.

"But the point is Sartilan's Assertion!"

"No, it isn't! Sartilan's Assertion is meaningless unless you take into account that Hopper SAW the APPLE!" His voice took on a shrill edge and he gesticulated wildly, his flaccid penis bouncing against his left leg.

Nearby, Brown Alice and Red Alice -- nicknamed for the colour of their beards to tell them apart -- were lying on their beds. Brown Alice was reading a thick tome entitled The Semiotics of the Encephalocele, and Red Alice was moving her lips as she quietly practiced a discourse for one of her philosophy classes. Brown Alice glanced up at James' group. "I'm trying to read, here," she called out. They took no notice, being now involved in a heated discussion about the importance of malic apparitions to the history Man's consciousness.

Beyond them, sitting on Gordon's bed with lap-desk and writing materials, Gordon was helping Winston with some sort of advanced maths. Across the centre aisle, Christine was pacing nervously beside her bed, her own writing supplies laid out on it. She always did this when having trouble writing. "Anything I can help with?" Oliver asked, gesturing to the half-paragraph she'd already written.

"Probably not. It's meant to be on the anatomy of the common earthworm as it relates to the Second Mathematical Law of Organic Geology."

"Ow. Sorry."

"Yeah." She sat down on the bed, opened a thick geological textbook and began looking for an appropriate chapter, absently scratching her beard.

"Oliver!" Natalie looked up from the book she was reading, lying on her belly on her bed. One of the visible pages of the book was an etching depicting a man and a woman each reaching a hand into the other's head by way of the ear. The man's other hand appeared to be on the woman's female area, but that could have been due to the artist's poor grasp of perspective. "Did you get that awful essay back from Professor Entworth?"

"Yeah," said Oliver, absently. He stepped closer to the book, but the text, including the caption curling on a ribbon at the bottom of the picture, was incomprehensible. "What is that?"

"Hmm? Oh, it's Disburger's Ith Omegratium Wethnitz. I'm reading it for Professor Lithbottom's Galtian class, but I don't understand much. So?"

"So what?"

"The essay! You only spent a week on it. How did it come out?"

"Oh. Not bad." Oliver grinned. "Here, have a look." He set his rucksack down on Natalie's bed and removed five sheets of paper covered in writing. At the top of the first one, in a different hand, was written: "Truly excellent understanding of the theorem. Only three punctuation errors. 97/100."

Natalie emitted an ear-piercing squeal such as Oliver had never heard from her before, which attracted the attention of everyone in the room. "That's wonderful!" she cried, jumping up from the bed. "I know you were having trouble with the calculus!" And then, she surprised Oliver even more by suddenly hugging him. Her skin felt smooth and soft against his body, and his penis -- had it been so hard a moment ago? -- was crushed between their two bellies.

Oliver, entirely uncertain what to do, froze. It probably lasted a few seconds, but it was hard for Oliver to tell. He was thinking that he really ought to be enjoying this. Other than handshakes, it was rare for him to actually touch a girl and he was also trying, stupidly, to think if he had ever done so before. Without bringing his mother into it, the only thing he could think of was a rather embarrassing episode during his first year at the Gramon secondary school.

It was the middle of a maths class. Oliver was seated near the back of the room, to avoid being called upon for anything -- a ruse which had never once worked, but he still tried it even at university. Next to him on the bench was a petite girl named Helena with short, blond hair and breasts slightly too large for her. Oliver was attempting, with little success, to pay attention to the teacher's discussion of the binomial theorem when Helena, apparently losing consciousness, fell sideways against him. Surprised, he moved without thinking about what he was doing, and somehow she ended up with her head in his lap, her lips actually touching his now-erect member. There was a quiet sound of water as she lost control of her bladder.

By now, the incident had attracted the attention of the rest of the class, and there was much murmuring and laughter. One young man, who had apparently recently learnt the word fellatio, was defining it in quite explicit terms, to the amusement of his classmates, many of whom would afterward find it amusing to ask Oliver what it was like. ("In the middle of class, too!") Oliver couldn't see the humour, especially after about the tenth time.

Helena was absent from school for some weeks following the incident, and it was eventually established that she had spent that time in hospital, recovering from what was termed a "voluntary overdose" of a substance extracted from mushrooms. This was also the subject of some humour among students who had not felt the coldness of her skin during the incident.

Natalie's skin, however, was quite pleasantly warm, and caused him a tingling sensation where it touched him manhood. Someone muttered something, the sound loud in an otherwise silent room. Natalie instantly blushed and pulled away from Oliver, looking quite as shocked by the hug as he was. He looked around. Christine was grinning in that disconcerting way she had, as though she was in on your deepest secrets. Red Alice looked like she was trying not to burst out laughing. Even James' group had lost the train of their argument, and were staring quite impolitely at Oliver and Natalie. They turned back to their papers and all started talking at once when they saw that Oliver had noticed them.

Natalie absently walked over and sat down on the toilet. "I-- I don't quite know what that was," she said, as her pee began splashing into the water.

"As far as I'm concerned, it never happened," Oliver said. Christine made a tiny snorting noise, as though she had thought better of laughing at that statement, but otherwise remained quiet. Oliver thought he would definitely be sneaking out behind the biology building again tonight.
