Denise, Kirsty and Claire's night at the Xmas party continued

"Right, lets go to the loo now, I'm bursting" announced Denise as Kirsty walked back into the room. "Erm, I'll be honest with you" replied Kirsty, slightly nervously, "I kind of killed two birds with one stone while I was outside having that cig"

"Oh, what. You didn't did you?"

"Yep, I just wee'd round the side of the building. Have you seen the length of the queue in there?" Kirsty announced nonchalantly. She sipped her glass of wine and leaned back in the big leather recliner, resting her bare, slender legs and high heeled feet across the desk.

"You'll come with me, won't you Claire?" asked Denise.

"I went earlier, don't you think we should get out of Chris's office, we might get in trouble for being here"

"Don't be silly, Chris is a wanker, I'll show you what I think of Chris" Denise snapped back.

Denise had never liked Chris, he had beaten her to promotion twice - not because of skill but simply because of the circle of influential friends he drank with. She walked over to the large potted Yucca plant by the desk and looked first left, then right.

"The queue is massive as well, I'm not dealing with all that for one wee"

Immediately Kirsty and Claire gasped and started giggling, as they were pretty sure what Denise was going to do.

"Do you dare me to do it?" asked Denise, as a mischevious half smile spread across her face.

"You're going to anyway" replied Claire, wondering where her sudden cheekiness had erupted from. Another fit of giggles started. Denise stopped laughing first.

"Shut up, you guys. Watch this".

She backed onto the plant pot and leaned forward quite a lot. Exposing a spectacular cleavage as she eased her lacey black knickers to the side with one hand - she still had half a glass of wine in the other. Denise looked around her luxurious surroundings and at the giggling faces of her two friends, her exposed pussy was only about an inch and a half away from the potting compost when she started to pee. A trickle at first, then a gush, then a stronger gush. She bit her bottom lip and tryed to slow down her flow, knowing that if she didn't, it may not be absorbed quickly enough and overflow.

"That plant needed watering" joked Denise as her flow came to a stop, "I'm doing him a favour really". As she stood up, a couple of stray drips were absorbed by the plush carpet and all three girls erupted into fits of giggling as they filled three more glasses of wine.

"Let's get out of here" said Claire, suddenly a bit worried about the circumstances. They walked back to join the party once again.

Before they knew it, more wine had flowed and it was time to go home. The one hundred and fifty or so guests spilled out into the car park in a mass exodous. As everyone clambered into their respective buses, Claire looked backwards towards the office building only to see the front doors being locked by the MD. She had been out of sync with her friends bladders all night, but at this point could do with going to the toilet. 'I only live twenty minutes away' she reassured herself.

The three girls sat near the back of the coach, away from the rowdier croud who were sat at the front. Twenty minutes into the journey and still not even halfway home, they noticed a girl called Tina, from marketing had started to argue with the bus driver - she was clearly very drunk. Over the rabble, they could only hear scraps of the dialogue;

"Why don't you just stop for one minute and let people off to piss!!!?"

The bus driver was reluctant

"It's gonna be a lot more disgusting in here if you DON'T let people off!"

She had general support from a group of fellow passengers, so the grumpy bus driver pulled into a lay-by.

"Right Everyone, wee stop! Boys on that side, girls on that side - lets go" Tina announced, imitating the demonstration given by cabin crew at the beginning of a flight. A group of 7 girls and 17 guys spilled out of the bus into the darkness "No peeking boys!" joked one of the girls. On the farside of the bus women squatted everywhere. Knickers were pulled down or to the side and the smell of cunt filled the air. As the selection of white bums in various kinds of squat were lit up for fleeting moments by passing traffic, desperately needed, hot piss steamed and splattered on the ice-cold tarmac. There was lots of laughing and joking as the guys, most of whom had finished first kept threatening to come round to the girls side and "put it on the internet" - although no one did.

Claire was sitting on the bus overhearing all this and it was quite a torment to her. As the final few girls re-boarded the bus she immediately regretted not joining them. Although she needed to go, she had not felt quite confident enough to piss with a load of women she barely knew. The three chatted amongst themselves, though Claire was increasingly despondant about the way the bus was stopping at every little village possible, letting people off in dribs and drabs. Thirty-five minutes in, Claire was not even halfway home and needed to pee badly. Although she did not tell her friends of her predicament, the way she was crossing her legs and showing no interest in the wine Denise had smuggled on board kind of gave the game away.

After 45 minutes had passed the bus was empty apart from a group of guys sat in the mid section. Denise, Claire and Kirsty spread out onto other seats nearer the back, Claire picking the back-right seat so she could hold herself discreetly. As they went over a bump it happened, Claire lost a hot squirt into her see-through thong which was absorbed directly by the seat. She asked Denise "Do you think you can get the driver to stop again? I don't feel well and could really do with getting off the bus for just a minute"

"No problem hun" said Denise reassuringly "It happens to the best of us, you'll feel better once you've been sick, it's all part of the process".

Denise walked up to the front to have a word with the driver.

"I'm sorry mate, but could you pull over again, just for a moment - my friends not feeling well"

"Oh for fucks sake, what is it with you girls!" shouted the rude, obnoxious driver. "Throw up in your handbag for all I care, I shouldn't have to deal with it! We're only ten minutes from our last stop just tell her to hold on!"

Denise walked back, quite shocked at how she had been spoken to.

"I'm sorry Claire, I hate to say it but that man is a misereable cunt".

Upon hearing this news Claire lost a tiny bit more into her underwear. She beckoned Denise close and whispered into her ear "I'm actually dying for a wee and I'm going to do it here".

At this point, she knew she had no choice.

"It'll serve the bastard right, you go girl! I'll chat to those guys, and Kirsty will chat to the driver, that should give you long enough"

Claire leaned forward in her seat and moved her sparkly, black dress from under her firm tender bum-cheeks. She pretended to look for something in her bag and let go of a strong, five second spurt. While it soaked straight through her underwear and into the seat she was worried about the noise. 'I can't believe I'm doing this' thought Claire as, bit by bit, her pussy pulsated releasing controlled small spurts into the seat. Her face flushed bright red as she felt a wave of relief and, luckily, no one was paying her any attention whatsoever. Around a minute later, the last bits trickled out through her tight, young lips and all of a sudden Claire felt very tired. She moved a couple of seats across inspecting the large wet-patch on the seat out of the corner of her eyes. 'God, my underwear is soaked' thought Claire to herself 'but other than that I'm fine, I'll just bin them on the walk home'.

Denise and Kirsty returned to their friend. Both girls eyed the wet seat and had to hold back from giggling.

"Thanks guys, I couldn't have done that without your help - I was dying!!"

The bus pulled up as Kirsty responded "That's alright Babes, you're one of us now", "Yeah, that drivers a right misereable sod, he deserved that".

They walked off into the night and as soon as the bus was out of sight Claire let her knickers drop off her hips onto the ground and kicked them into a darkened doorway near the bus stop. The girls laughed into the night.

EPILOGUE

The next day Kirsty drove into work very hung over. She parked her car in her regular space round the side of the office building - the same place she had being weeing last night. In the cold light of day it looked like a very open location and gave her a funny feeling thinking about what she had done - despite the hangover, a wry smile spread across her face.

What intruiged Kirsty was the fact that her puddle was still there, obvious on the pale concrete slabs. It was a triangular kind of shape with a stream coming off it which snaked it's way off the kerb and almost to the end of her parking space. This amused Kirsty 'I had no idea I wee'd that much' she thought to herself. What amused her more was the fact that as well as her puddle, there were two streaks up the wall with streams of their own. There were also three more quite obvious 'lady-puddles' further along the path with streams leading off them too. 'I can't have been the only one then, perhaps I started a trend' Kirsty chuckled to herself as she entered the office.

Later that morning, Denise was taking notes in a meeting which happened to be in Chris's office. She could not help but notice the faint hum of piss in the room and smiled to herself knowingly.

Back in the main office Claire clicked open an email which read as follows:

FROM MANAGEMENT

TO ALL

RE: XMAS DO DISCONTINUATION

It has come to our attention that the privaledge of the Xmas party this year has been somewhat abused and as a result this event is being discontinued.

The upper management wish to convey that just because there is free alcohol available does not mean that people should abuse this to excess. Around the office there have been pools of vomit left by those who were clearly too irresponsible to handle their drink. This has been cleaned up at great extra expense to the company. In addition to this, we have recieved word that some of the men chose to use the side of the building as an impromptu toilet last night, this also has to be chemically cleaned at great expense to the company.

As if this were not bad enough two out of the three buses had incedences of vomit costing the company �200 soiling charge per bus. The bus company informs us that on the third bus, despite making an unscheduled stop for those who felt unable to control themselves, someone saw fit to urinate on the actual bus. This amounts to not only an extra �600 fee but also a lot of shame and disrepute on the company name.

I'm sure you all can understand that, as a consequence we must discontinue this event and we apologise to those not responsible for any wrongdoing.

Claire sipped her coffee and blushed, hoping that nobody knew which individuals were responsible. Beside her desk one of her older colleagues, Christine, read over her shoulder; "Aren't blokes disgusting? Pissing everywhere, why can't they just hold it like us?"

Claire simply nodded and smiled.
