When Kryssie met Martin, part one

A while ago I wondered what it would be like if two characters from the stories here met up, what follows is obviously complete fiction but its a story of what might have happened if Kaele1gh's character Kryssie and Martin ever connected...

"Things could be worse sir"

Just at that particular time I was wondering if that was possible, Standing at the information desk in the departures lounge at Cape Town airport, lastcall for my flight, no passport, no ticket, no wallet, very little money and only the clothes I stood up in.

Coming to the airport had been a folorn hope at best, I had woken on the beach with an awful hangover some five hours earlier, what a party that had been!. As the fog in my brain cleared I realised all I had on me was a few banknotes and some loose change, no wallet and so no hotel key. Given the state I was in I was surprised I was still dressed!, after looking, without any luck, for any belongings I may have dropped, I decided the best course of action was to head to my hotel.

With only a vague idea of where I was going I nevertheless found my hotel and told the receptionist of my predicament, she kindly furnished me with a key-card for my room and I headed for the lift still feeling reasonably light hearted, I had more money and a spare credit card in my room, hidden in my suitcase along with my passport and plane ticket. I'd make a few phone calls, cancel the lost credit cards, shower, change and head to the airport.

Arriving at my room I inserted the card and opened the door, the room was neat and tidy, just as I had left it, too neat in fact, no jacket, camera or suitcase, maybe the hotel had taken my things down to the lobby, it was very close to check-out time, maybe, just maybe...

There was nothing in the luggage room or indeed anywhere in reception, the hotel was very apologetic but if sir had lost his wallet and room key, it was hardly their fault, they would call the police for me but this was Cape Town, the police would have more pressing things to do, I should not expect them to come immediately.

I phoned the bank and credit card companies to cancel my cards and decided to head for the airport on the hotel bus, maybe I could still get on the plane somehow... everything else could be sorted when I got back to the UK.

That was how I came to be standing in the airport dressed in sandals, a loud Hawaian shirt and even louder shorts, feeling very fed up and wondering what the hell I was going to do next.

"Trouble?" ... a voice behind me asked

I turned around and there, standing about a metre away was one of the prettiest girls I think I have ever seen, red curly hair ( I have a weakness for redheads) very pretty face, striking blue eyes and a skimpy sun dress which was doing its best to camoflague a gloriously sexy figure, even in my sorry predicament I couldn't help noticing the curvy outline of her breasts and just a hint of nipple poking through the thin fabric. She looked to be about about 25, hard to tell, a good bit younger than me anyway, but there was something about her...

"you should close that before you catch flies"

"Sorry" I said

"your mouth, you should close it before something flies right in there"

I grinned... "sorry, was I that obvious?"

"just a bit... so what happened to you?, you look as though you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders"

"almost" I replied " too much of a tale of woe to bother you with"

"Try me, maybe I can help, lets grab a beer and you can tell auntie Kryssie all about it"

"Kryssie, nice name... Martin" I replied, extending a hand... surprisingly firm handshake, " you always pick up strangers in airports?"

Kryssie smiled "only the sorry looking ones"

We headed over to the bar and got a couple of beers while I recounted the events of the last five hours. Kryssie was very apologetic for the way her fellow countymen had treated a visitor and said she wanted to help...

"Thanks", I replied, "thats very kind, but its really not your problem"

"Well, it sort of is" Kryssie said "I work in a tourist related field, anyway, I know a few people and the quicker we can get you sorted, the quicker we can get your miserable face out of here... its bad for the industry" Kryssie was grinning widely now and it was very infectious, I couldn't help but grin back.

"That's better, now lets make some phone calls"

She took out a phone and started dialling, speaking a mixture of English and what I took to be Afrikaans, she paused occasionally to fire questions at me... Full name, date of birth, airline, destination.

After about ten minutes she put her phone away, "right, mostly sorted" Kryssie started writing on a napkin " you've got an appointment at the British Consulate this afternoon, I'm writing the address and the name of the person you're going to see, they should be able to provide you with papers so you can leave the country, you should also be able to get a bit of money to tide you over, only about a thousand Rand, but its better than nothing. I've contacted the airline, there's no problem with the ticket, just take the papers you get from the consulate with you when you re-book your flight"

"Wow, you did all that??... brains as well as beauty"

Kryssie blushed " anything else you need?"

"only your phone number... just teasing... how far is it to the consulate?"

"about fifteen kilometers, give or take"

"and where can I get a bus?"

"mmm, not sure about that one, let me give you a lift, I'm headed that way anyway, I live near the beach" she said

"please don't trouble yourself, you've done quite enough already"

"hey, its no bother, besides I want to make sure you get there"

"well, if you're sure" I said

We left and headed for the car park, Kryssie was driving an open topped four-wheel drive of some sort, difficult to tell what it was it was, it was so covered in dust, I hung on for dear life as she negotiated the exit and sped out onto the road with scant regard for stop signs or other road users. We arrived at the consulate barely twenty five minutes later, Kryssie scribbled her phone number and an address on a piece of paper.

"just in case" ... "good luck", she said goodbye and gave me a hug and a quick peck on the cheek before pulling out into the traffic and speeding off.

The consulate were very efficient and after much form filling and phone calls back to the UK, they gave me an envelope containing the papers I needed and another containing a wad of notes, the flight proved a little more difficult, there wasn't one available for four days, so they gave me the address of an hostel in Cape Town which would bill them directly, and sent me on my way.

I headed out the door onto the street and paused to look at the directions to the hostel, hmmm four days and a thousand rand, not a huge amount of money but I'd got by on less in my younger days... shouldn't be a problem. My thoughts were shattered by the sound of a car horn and I looked up to see a grinning Kryssie, a sight I could get very used to.

"your taxi to the airport awaits"

"thanks, but you're four days early"

"what???"

"no flights until Saturday, they've put me up in a hostel"

"Where?"

I showed her the address

"you can't stay in that dump, even the rats won't stay in that hole... oh dear god, that means you're going to have to stay with me"

A part of me wanted to object and say that she'd done more than enough... but a guy would be a fool to turn down an offer like that, and I'm a lot of things, but I'm no fool !!

"Don't just stand there, jump in"

We stopped on the way so that I could buy a toothbrush and a couple of pairs of briefs and in no time we arrived at Kryssies apartment.

"I'm heading for the beach to watch the volleyball, you can come if you like or get your head down for a few hours, up to you"

I opted for the beach, as much as I wanted to sleep, I wanted even more to spend time with this amazing person, friendly, efficient and sexy... very sexy.

Arriving at the beach we paused at the volleyball area, not much activity so I suggested we went for a paddle.

"ok, but watch out for the jellyfish, one or two drift ashore occasionally and they are MONSTERS!!"

"ah, but I'm sure a helpful, resourceful lady like you would know how to treat a jellyfish sting"

Kryssie half smiled "nope, no idea" she said

"well I hear urine is good for jellyfish stings, I'm sure a kind girl like you would pee on me rather than see me in pain" I grinned

"well, I'll pee on you if that's what you want... but its a myth that urine is any good for jellyfish stings, still whatever turns you on"

My shorts may have been loud, but not loud enough to hide the swelling that was occurring inside them, a sight that wasn't missed by the observant Kryssie.

She laughed "and I see that it DOES turn you on"

"I have no idea what you mean" I grinned "its just the way the shorts hang"

"Its not the way they hang that interests me so much as what they're hanging on"

"are all South African girls as forward as this?"

Kryssie licked her lips "the horny ones are"

"Now now young lady, I'm old enough to be your... erm ... older brother"

"Oh I know how old you are, you told me your date of birth, you're forty-two and I'm twenty-eight and if it doesn't bother you, it sure as hell doesn't bother me, but lets not run before we can walk"

My smile faded slightly.

"awww put away the long face, you walk by putting one foot in front of the other, now lets walk and get something to eat... I'm starving"

We walked in silence towards the beach bar.

"look I'm sorry if I've overstepped the boundary, I can be stupid and impetuous at times, and this hasn't been one of my best days"

"shhh" Kryssie put a finger on my lips "let's go and get a burger and a couple of very, very large drinks and see what happens"

Kryssie glanced at my shorts "that's better, its good to see you smile again"

We sat in the shade and ate our burgers, each of us with a plastic cup containing a good litre of coke

I started to apologise again but was immediately hushed by Kryssie

"its more my fault than yours" she said "you're not the only one with a tale of woe"

"I'm all ears, tell uncle Martin all about it"

It transpired that Kryssie had broken up up with a long term boyfriend about two months earlier, the relationship had been going nowhere and so there had been a mutual decision to quit before things got in too much of a rut.

"the thing is, although the sparkle had gone out of the relationship, the sex was great, a little predictable but still great" Kryssie had a far away look in her eyes, then turning to look directly at me continued " and then I saw you at the airport, you looked sad and needy and I sort of am too, I'm not ready for another relationship just yet, but I'm getting as horny as hell so I thought, what the fuck, a quick one nighter and I'll never see you again. I'm not normally like this, but it seemed an ideal solution. There, I've said it... god you must think I'm such a slut"

She was staring fixedly at her feet and blushing crimson

"No, not a slut, just refreshingly honest" I said "so you knew all along I wouldn't be flying out tonight... and I thought men were devious"

"I knew you wouldn't be flying out tonight, but I wasn't planning on four days, still it gives me a chance to get to know you a little better and feel less like a cheap whore"

I smiled "don't think you would ever be cheap" I half whispered

"I heard that!" Kryssie said, poking me hard in the stomach

"ouch... not there, you've just poked a litre of coke!!"

Kryssie grinned and took aim again but before her finger could hit its target I leaned quickly forwards and tickled her. Kryssie's eyes shot wide open in horror...

"don't!!, I'll wet myself" and so of course I tickled her again

"oooohhh stop it"

"it was your idea to have the supersize cola" I said smiling "its not my fault you can't hold it, besides, I didn't start this"

"Not here" Kryssie hissed between clenched teeth, "lets go"

Grabbing my hand, we set off at a fast walk along the beach, Kryssie dragging me in tow, though in truth, she didn't need to drag very hard.

After about a hundred metres or so the beach was quite deserted, Kryssie in obvious discomfort, lowered herself gently onto the sand.

"You look like you're sitting on a thorn" I said "... bladder a little full??"

"Not a little, it's bloody damn near ready to burst"

"so you wouldn't want me to tickle you again"

Kryssie gingerly got onto her knees and shuffled towards me, then lowered herself onto my lap.

"you tickle me now and I won't be responsible for the consequences"

She lifted the hem of her dress and showed me a pair of black briefs, somehow the mens underwear seemed even more sexy than the most expensive lingerie ever could.

"present from a friend" she said

I could see a slight damp patch, even through the black fabric, and my cock stiffened in appreciation, hesitantly I touched the taut black cloth, tracing the contours I could feel beneath, then without warning I tickled her hard. Kryssie's eyes opened in shock and before she could say anything I clamped my mouth over hers and held her tightly, kissing her as a flood of warmth poured over my lap.

After about a minute Kryssie pulled her head back, her eyes closed and she started to rock back and forth, rubbing her pussy against my hard cock, humming and sighing softly, occasionally pausing to let out another small squirt, then continuing the rocking motion until the rubbing got faster and faster. Finally, with a soft cry she let loose a huge gush and thrust hard against me. Shuddering, Kryssie pushed me onto my back and lay on top of me.

We lay like that for a while, then Kryssie opened one eye and grinned at me.

"well thats definately the most fun I've had with my clothes on"

"I'm pleased to hear it" I said "now get off my bladder before it bursts"

Kryssie shufffled backwards and started to rub my hard cock through my shorts.

"now what?" she said

"I need to pee NOW!" I replied

Kryssie stood up and said "don't let me stop you"

I stood beside her, both of us facing the sea, and with some difficulty extracted my straining cock from my shorts. Kryssie looked at me and then my cock.

"want to hold it"

"oh fuck, yes please... can I?

I nodded and she took hold of me gently. After about ten seconds or so, a small trickle started to dribble into the sand, Kryssie started to wank my cock slowly as the flow increased, occasionally letting the pee cascade over her hand. When the stream subsided, Kryssie knelt quickly and kissing the tip tucked me back inside my shorts.

"Lets get back to the apartment right now" she said, and hand in hand we walked towards the car, my mind racing about the possibilities of what might be going to happen when we got back there...
