As I promised Kaele1gh, this one is dedicated to her 500th post.

A Story For Kaeleigh

«Mr. Johnson», the attendant softly intoned. I stirred from my sleep. «Please put your seat back in its upright position. We'll be landing soon.»

I had finally dozed off in the last ninety minutes of the flight, not long after I'd returned from the restroom for the second time. The eleven hours since leaving London had been fitful, the seats were cramped, the flight frequently bumpy and clouds obscured the view most of the way. But, I was upbeat. In a few minutes I'd be arriving in Johannesburg and for the next two weeks would be traveling through the surrounding countryside.

As a professional videographer, I've led a pretty interesting life. In a career spanning more than two decades I've worked assignments on three continents and, now, Africa makes four. I'd come here to produce a video for American television documenting a program that develops park rangers and wildlife conservationists.

The landing was probably the smoothest part of the flight. At least it felt that way to me after the day's journey. It was probably another ten minutes before I was finally off the plane and another five walking through the terminal to the line for customs. Less than an hour later I was in baggage claim.

My bag was already waiting for me at the side of the carousel. Grabbing it, I walked over to the ground transportation counter. Now, if only I could find my driver. The letter from the foundation told me they would send one of their representatives to meet me there. I just needed to find this person, who would be holding a sign bearing their logo and my name written on it. Looking around, I noticed no one matching this description and I started to worry, when I saw a woman standing apart from the others, almost in front of the car rental desks, and carrying a sign that read, «Johnson».

She was definitely attractive, but maybe a little too stiff in a tan business jacket that looked somewhat out of place. Probably just on the dark side of thirty, tall, dark red hair, apparently athletic, and most likely the kind of woman who really enjoyed the outdoors.

I extended my right hand and looked squarely into her deep green eyes. «J. Gladstone Johnson, but my friends all call me Glad.»

Returning my handshake, she gave a warm genuine smile and introduced herself. «I'm Kaleigh, Kaleigh Mitchell». Her firm grip indicated that she was someone you'd do best to take seriously, yet there was also something gracious and feminine about her and, I suspected, sensuous. But, that awful, ill-fitting blazer wasn't doing anything to conjure up those images.

«You look a little tired. Can I carry anything for you»? I offered up my overnight bag, grabbed the larger bag in my right hand and, throwing the video kit over my shoulder, we headed out to find the car.

On the way, she inquired, «And, what does the J stand for?»

«Jonathan» I replied. «After an uncle.»

It was easy locating the gray Land Rover in the lot. Once in, she shed the jacket immediately, apparently reading my thoughts. «It's a little confining», she said, as she tossed it into the back. Just as quickly, I discarded any reservations I might have had.

As she changed into trail boots, I was able to get a much better look at her. She was wearing a khaki sleeveless dress that came most of the way down her well-shaped thighs and revealed toned arms. While the neckline was conservative, I glimpsed signs of ample cleavage, which was only enhanced by the silky black bra that peeked through her armholes.

Kaleigh started the car. We backed up and headed out the lot. Within a few turns I was already lost before we had left the airport. Moving effortlessly through the mid-afternoon traffic, I could tell she was a good driver by the time we exited for the Eastern Bypass.

She was also a great conversationalist, making me feel very welcome in a strange place «I've been assigned to take you one of the villages this evening. We stay at one of the camps tonight, then tomorrow I'll take you out in the field. In fact, you're going to be stuck with me for the next two weeks».

I could have done a whole lot worse.

The flight had given me a mild headache on top of my fatigue. Probably a little dehydrated, I thought. I asked if she had any water.

«Oh, you must be thirsty. You probably didn't drink enough on the plane. Grab yourself a bottle from the back right now, and you'll probably need another two to make up for what you lost on the flight. I always try to carry at least a half dozen liters when I travel in the bush.»

While her eyes seldom strayed from the highway, I could see she was looking me over.

«You know, you remind me of a guy I met when I was a bridesmaid at a wedding a few years back. He was a number of years older than you, but so interesting to talk with that I spent the whole reception with him. I went there hating it, having to wear this ugly pink dress, but left having had a most wonderful time. We stayed in touch for a while, he was such a dear man, but we never acted on our mutual attractions.»

That was a good sign, I thought. Like maybe being compared to a favorite uncle, only younger, perhaps better-looking and hopefully more virile. Sounded, too, like she wished things had ended differently.

I had finished the second water bottle by now and was well into the third. The road had long changed from four lanes to two, and the pavement now was frequently broken or cratered.

I was almost getting used to the roughness of the road, as Kaleigh spoke up again.

«I don't know if they explained to you the protocol for bodily functions. First, try not to use a toilet unless you absolutely have to. Water is scarce out here and frequently unavailable. When you need to pee, we'll just stop and you go by the side. For the other bit of business, we step behind a tree and dig a hole. Most facilities in these parts are pretty primitive and you can get some pretty nasty infections if you don't clean up afterward.»

Then she added, «I'm rather used to it and I'm sure you will catch on quickly».

Did I notice a tone of excitement in her descriptions, or maybe a peculiar glint in her eyes? No, I couldn't be hearing it. Making a mental note to dismiss the thought, I attributed it to my fatigue from the long trip.

Up to now she had been almost motionless behind the wheel, save for a couple of the steeper turns and the occasional gearshift. After she finished her last sentence, though, she adjusted herself a couple times on the seat, then sat a little more upright. I thought I heard her faintly sigh as we went over a one of the deeper potholes.

The water I'd gulped down over the last couple hours had also caught up with me. I was getting a little too full, too fast and knew shortly I would be desperate . I looked again at Kaeleigh. She was clenching the wheel and I thought I could see her thigh muscles tensing. If she really needed to go, too, why was she teasing me like this? I returned my gaze to the road ahead, squirmed in my seat, knowing that the next bump in the road could cause me to lose all control. We continued, silently playing this game of dare for maybe the next six or so miles. Finally a hundred-meter patch of rough asphalt convinced me I could no longer hold.

I took another look at her, then yielded «Can we stop soon?»

«Any time.»

A minute later we pulled over.

Tired from the long plane ride, I must have moved in slow motion. In the time that I climbed out of my seat and took two steps in the dust, she had opened her door, walked around the back and was standing not more than five feet from me. I probably didn't move a muscle for the next ten seconds, mostly because I was pretty spent by now, but deep inside I really was interested in seeing how this was going to play out.

Kaeleigh broke the stalemate. «Don't tell me you're pee shy. I'm not.» Then, with her left hand she reached under her dress and pulled her black panties to the side. I had started to look away when she said, half challengingly, «You're welcome to watch».

In one graceful motion she lifted the front hem of the dress to her waist. Then, bending her knees a little so she was somewhere between full standing and a high squat, she set her feet apart a little wider than her shoulders.

«Here, let me show you how it's done in the bush.»

In that moment, she released a trickle that darted past her red pubic hairs, falling between of her boots. Then, leaning back, she must have pushed hard as a thick, powerful stream sprayed out in front of her missing my feet by only inches. In twenty seconds it was all over, when she sharply cut off her flow.

I never broke eye contact with her performance. I couldn't believe it, I'd only met this most gorgeous woman three hours earlier and here she was peeing right in front of me and seemingly enjoying giving me a show.

She broke the silence. «That was SO good. I hadn't done that since right after breakfast, running errands all morning, then picking you up». I didn't know what to say. I was still looking at her amazing, slightly damp, red-haired pussy as she slipped her undies back into place. The whole thing was more than enough to give me a major arousal.

My stare was only broken by her command, «It's your turn».

Did I have a choice? I really needed to piss, anyway. I unbuttoned my pants, loosened the zipper, and pulled my penis over the top of my briefs. I stood there, trying to relieve my uncomfortable fullness. Except, I had a small, no, make that larger than normal, problem. My bladder was full, so much so that my gut ached, my back was spasming and I still couldn't piss.

Finally, after what seemed an hour, I softened enough that the first dozen or so drops came out, embarrassingly falling straight down. Talk about performance anxiety, I couldn't even reach the puddle she'd made in the dust. A moment later, as I was berating myself for the terrible first impression I must have made, I was in full flow. It was as if someone had just turned on a faucet, and I released a torrent, though much thinner than hers, but falling about four feet past where she stood. Had she not seen it coming and taken a couple steps back, I would have hit her about waist high. All the while she stood staring at the end of my shaft.

But, like a good movie, the ending was over much too soon.

We got back in the car, and headed down the pothole-scarred road. The pavement seemed to get worse the further we went along. It was still a good two hours to our stop for the evening, two more hours of bumps, rattles and other tortures, more than enough to shake the piss out of you.

I had finished up my last water bottle. I closed my eyes and tried to relax, hard to do with this vague, yet wonderful excitement feeling in the bottom of my stomach. About an hour and a half later, Kaeleigh nudged me from my half-sleep.

«I usually take a pee when I'm about fifteen minutes away. One never knows what things are like in some of the villages». Saying that, she took a couple long swigs from her water bottle.

I could have sworn I saw the flash of a wicked smile out the corner of my eye.

Twenty minutes later we pulled to a stop.

Having already gotten rid of our pee inhibitions, we stood just off the road, next to one another. I noticed I had filled again nicely, neither painful nor bursting like the time before, but just a nice feeling of fullness, nonetheless.

This time, I was the one to start. «Here, how about if I go first,» I said, unzipping. Pulling my cock out, I released almost immediately. There was enough pressure in me to send an arc out about nine feet.

Kaeleigh exhaled, «Nice!» Then, with no warning, she reached over with her right hand and grabbed my shaft. I almost stopped

«Hey, easy,» I gasped. She softened her grip a little and, despite being semi-erect, the flow returned almost as before for about fifteen seconds. Near the end, I pushed a little harder to get the last bit out. She gave me a couple shakes, let go and I was done.

«Now� it's my turn,» she giggled, sounding a little short of breath.

This time she pulled her panties down, then over her shoes one by one. Holding them in her left hand, she reached up and pulled the dress up, fully exposing her pussy. She slowly moved her right hand over her slightly swollen middle, then down. Fully standing now, she parted her lips and a few drops came out, �then a spurt, �then a full stream. She could only pee about half as far as I did, but it was more powerful - and lasted longer. I enjoyed the great view while it lasted, and was all too disappointed when it sputtered to an end. She finished up, bouncing a little to get the remaining drops to fall.

Stepping back in the Landy, we uneventfully made it to the village.

We hadn't even gotten to our first night's destination and already two terrific pee experiences. I could tell this was going to be a wonderful couple weeks!
