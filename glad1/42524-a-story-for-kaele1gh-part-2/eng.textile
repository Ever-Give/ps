I woke in what seemed the middle of the night with a full bladder. It had probably only been only three or four hours after sunset, but it felt much later. For a moment I was unsure where I was, then remembered the past day's events.

Unzipping the entrance screen, I stepped outside. I stood still just outside the tent for a few seconds, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the darkness, and looked around. A quarter-moon low on the horizon now gave barely enough light to see where I was stepping. «Well� most of the time», I muttered under my breath, as I slammed my foot into what I though was a root.

The pain, while not intense, as I was spared from far worse by my trail boots, was enough to distract me for a few moments from how badly I needed to piss. I hobbled around aimlessly for maybe thirty seconds, though at the time it seemed much longer. Then, behind me, I heard the unmistakable metallic sound of a tent zipper being opened. Turning around, I saw a woman's form, and in the short seconds it took for me to recognize Kaele1gh, she called out in a stage whisper, «Glad, what are you doing here?»

«Trying to take a piss», I replied, «until I�»

«Tripped over my tent stake.» She finished my sentence, then adding. «You woke me and now I need to take one, too. Shall we go together? I have an idea. Follow me.»

In the pale light I could make out she was wearing an oversized, long-sleeve t-shirt that came down almost a foot below her waist, the requisite trail boots and, I guessed, no panties

.

About fifteen steps in front of us was the edge of a small, steep cliff that descended maybe twenty feet or so to the river valley. It served as a natural barrier from most predators. We walked towards it, then, taking my right hand in her left, she carefully led me about of the third of the way down the slope. We turned around, our backs now facing the river and she stepped in front of me a foot or two further uphill and pressed her lovely, firm ass into my stomach. I immediately pulled down my shorts, then, with both hands, lifted up her shirt and we stood half-naked in the loose, dusty soil. I wrapped my arms around her, first lightly touching the underside of her supple breasts, then crossed them over her taut belly.

My fingers slid down to the top of her thighs, then slowly pulling them up, I softly parted her lips. Her right hand reached around, grabbed my cock and gently pulled it forward until it was between her legs and no more than an inch below her pussy. We were motionless for a few exciting breaths, deeply inhaling and savoring this wet, delicious moment, and then, almost simultaneously, began peeing. Our arcs jetted forward three, maybe four feet, as I slightly adjusted my hands so our streams met for a dozen seconds as we emptied. She wasn't pushing as hard this time and I stopped before she did, and as she shook out my last drops, I felt her, too, nearing the end. Her pee fell straight down, then after a couple quick spurts, she too was done. Standing there for what seemed like hours, neither one of us wanted this special time to end.

Finally, I loosened my arms and she took a step forward. Pulling my shorts back up, I followed her up the hill as we walked back to our tents.

While I found the sleeping arrangements better than I rightly should have expected, there was one area in which I thought could have stood improvement. But, honestly, it really would have been pushing things for Kaele1gh and I to share a tent on our first evening.

We both rose shortly after first light. There was no need for an alarm clock here. One woke to Nature's rhythms, the sunrise, the noise of birds and the movements of the larger animals.

I rolled out of my sleeping bag and stood up after hearing Kaele1gh unzip her tent. I shook out my boots, put them on and opened the zipper on mine. I stepped out, and

Kaele1gh greeted me, «Morming, Glad. Sleep alright? Or, did things go bump in the night?»

She was wearing a khaki long-sleeve shirt this morning, along with matching bush shorts, dark socks rolled low and a different pair of trail boots, giving me another look at her long, well-shaped legs.

As I walked over to her, she finished setting up the camp stove, then, placed a large kettle of water to be heated for tea and lit the flame.

«Yeah, I slept pretty good, I guess, except I tossed and turned a pretty bit until I finally dropped off. Guess I was still excited by the events of the evening». I made sure I was in full eye contact with Kaele1gh now. «After I got back to sleep, I didn't hear anything until a few minutes ago.»

«I was all tingly all night, too, and now got to go take my waking-up pee. It can feel so good after being all too full,» rubbing just below her stomach to emphasize the point, «that sometimes it's the best part of my day.»

I guess I had to go pretty badly, too, since it only took that little bit of encouragement to put me to the edge of desperation.

Shifting from leg to the other, I confided. «I need a pee, too. Over to the hill again?»

Kaele1gh silently nodded.

We walked back to the cliff edge, near where we'd been a few hours before. This time in the early light it looked so much different. What we had thought had been a twenty-foot drop was at least half again that, fooled by the low scrub that separated the cliffs from the mud flats along the river. And, while it was too early to see much into the shadows across the river, along the edge of the shore I thought I could make out a small herd of impala taking advantage of the water source.

Five feet apart, we took a few steps down the embankment, then stopped. Still standing, Kaele1gh grabbed the left leg of her shorts and pulled it aside, fully exposing her pussy to the morning sun. I followed suit, tugging on the bottom of my shorts, and welcoming my cock into the daylight.

Looking over at me, she chimed, «Since we're both bursting, I thought I'd give us a countdown. THREE � TWO � ONE � PEE.»

We released almost simultaneously. Kaele1gh started with a quick spurt, then a thick torrent that traveled about five feet down the hill. I let loose a slender arc that fell almost ten feet away, then I turned slightly to my right and aimed so it fell on the puddle Kaele1gh was making.

Coming from my right were the sounds of short, excited breathing and soft giggling. She must be having as much fun with this as I was. I could see her cast a couple sidelong glances at me, staring at my cock and jet of piss coming out of it, then looking out at the growing pool in front of her. She tried pushing a little harder. It gave her almost no more distance, but spread out the area she was covering.

We continued this mutual pee for maybe twenty seconds, until my stream fell back. Pinching off the last couple drops, I was done. She continued a few more seconds, sharply cut off, then wiped the remaining drops with her fingertips.

She turned again to look at me. « All done. That felt SO good, the holding all night and then just letting go. Looks like you needed to go as bad as me, too.» Then she added, «I like how you and I can pee together like this. It's kind of like we're best friends.»

Oh! She used that f-word. At least she didn't say brother. But, then I remembered her stories about the young trail guide she'd had a crush on and the older man at the wedding, and something about missed opportunities. And, there was something, well, hopeful about the way she said it.

Together, we walked back to the camp, poured ourselves a couple steel travel mugs of tee and started to take down our tents. By the time we'd finished them we had packed up everything but the stove and loaded it all into the landy.

Filling our containers a second time, we used up the remaining water in the pot, then took another walk back towards the cliff, waiting for the stove to cool.

We sat down a couple steps below the top of the hill. The sun was higher in the sky, so we could now make out more detail on the far side. Probably a lot good places for wildlife to gather along the river, and plenty of trees for birds to nest.

I wanted to know more about Kaele1gh's work. Since the subject was near and dear to her, she was all to eager to fill me in.

«Nearly everybody, including most funders, don't have a clue what the project is really about. Unless they actually ask for more, they only get a brief lacking in detail They think it's about conservation, when it's really about developing people to manage our resources, including the human ones. I am most passionate about wanting to help these people, but also conservation and wildlife are also goals for me. Then I got the idea of putting the two together. Conservation struggles to get funds, but if you join it to development of rural people you can approach twice as many aid organisations. And if you also add in that I would ensure 60% of the learners would be women, you can obtain aid funding from women empowerment groups.»

Changing the subject to matters at hand, she continued, «Glad, I'm really envious of how far you can piss. I know I can hold for a very long time, and usually have a good, strong flow, but I can't push it out like you can or have much control where it goes, �except that I never pee on my shoes. Do you suppose you can give me a few�uh�pointers?»

«Honestly, Kaele1gh, most women can actually pee further than men. I couldn't help notice that you are such a powerpisser, I think you're a natural for distance. All you really need to do is pull your lips aside just enough to make sure your pee hole is in the clear and maybe lift up a little so your stream goes out straight. Since you can't see it too well, you're going to have to rely on what you feel. One more thing, you don't want to get too full like you're bursting when you do this, or it will just trickle.»

«I know. Sometimes I guess I do hold it too long.»

She went back to talking about her other passion. «�so we train unemployed people to become rangers at entry level. We use drill and discipline like military training, to break people down, weed out the weak and lackadaisical, and then build them back up. Then, we add other skills like fire management, tourism management, financial management, water provision management, human resource management, and so on. They will use firearms, hence the drill and discipline. Once we get into the wildlife areas and you put your life in the hands of a man with a rifle that will be the only thing between you and a charging elephant, you will understand why the need for such military type training.

But, we also do the soft skills, and take an holistic approach.»

I asked her how I could best present her program. «You would need to get to know the people, make sure you capture the essence of the training, downplay the military training which is not popular with funders, but play up the weapons handling. Then, you get the women in action, as one chunk of funding is for women empowerment, show the villages and village life and then, most importantly edit it well with lots of wildlife and African scenery, as in the end wildlife still gets in more money than anything else.»

The tea had taken its effect. Kaele1gh's breathing had become a little more excited, and by the time she started softly bouncing her cheeks on the ground, announced, «Oh, Dr. Glad! Guess it's time for me to take my first lesson.»

I looked over at her and, making full eye contact, asked «Ready? I suppose I should first get a good look at the�er, situation.» I was trying to maintain a serious look, but I think the outside corners of my mouth betrayed me. «Why don't you first get your shorts and panties off? It's less to get in the way.»

She peeled them back, then down her legs and over her shoes.

I knelt down to take a closer look. «You know, I really could have been a doctor� probably should have�can you imagine getting paid for this? We both laughed.

I continued the exam. «Good! You're urethra is far enough outside your vagina that it shouldn't be as problem to get a straight stream.» I lightly probed the area just below her clitoris. «Looks good! Let's see, the labial folds should be no problem, but you might want to pull some of your hair away as well, so it doesn't collect so many drops.»

«Hurry doctor, I really HAVE to pee.»

«Just allow me one more minute and you'll be good to go.» I wanted to get in a couple more looks in case I might be missing some aspect, but mostly because I was so enjoying this. It looked great from every angle Another thirty second of light touching and I gave her the go ahead, «OK, you're set. »

«Now, how do you want me to do this?»

«Why don't we try first with you sitting down, as you are».

I took the both index fingers, one on each side, and gently separated her lips, then lifted up, no more than half an inch.

«Now, why don't you put your fingers where mine are?» I guided her into place «I think this sort of touch should work. Lean back a little, so you can arc it up higher. And, remember, nice firm pressure, especially at the start and finish. Not too much, though, or your stream will spread out. Now, let go.»

It started slowly, a few spurts that danced a couple feet in front of her, then the stream widened and she arced her pee at least a foot beyond anything I'd seen her do before.

«Nice. Remember, you're not forcing anything,» I coached her. She continued peeing, not as thickly and noisily as her last couple ones, but it lasted longer. After thirty, maybe forty seconds, she slowed.

«Now, a big push at the end,» I reminded her. She did, then cut off.

Kaeleigh looked over at me, a big smile on her face. «Thanks! I guess I'll now have to repay the doctor for his services. Don't you have to pee?»

«Actually, I do. I think I would have wet my pants already if I hadn't been so aroused. Perhaps I better do this standing up.»

We got up off the ground. She pulled my shorts down to my ankles, then stepped me out of them.

«Fair is only fair,» she said.
