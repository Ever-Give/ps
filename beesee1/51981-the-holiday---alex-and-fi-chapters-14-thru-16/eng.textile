The saga continues. MODS! A word please. There is a section of 200 words in square brackets which I think essential to the story but which may contravene the PS code of practice. As I may not (perhaps never) post a sequel to these chapters, if it is unacceptable, might you remove just that section? Thanks.

Sylphide was dressed in a light blue blouse and one of those short skirts with black tights underneath. With long blonde hair and youth on her side she was stunning. Walking up to the pee trough, she simply lifted her hem and pushed down her tights to just above her knees in an easy flowing motion, revealing beautiful smooth buttocks. Beneath her tights was a pair of light blue panties which she pulled aside to show her petite pussy, with trimmed blond fur surrounding it. Standing about three feet back from the trough and leaning back slightly she pushed a stream of deep yellow piss in a terrific jet that went almost straight from her pee-hole into the target.

As she finished, she let her knickers back into place so that her last short stream darkened them. Already I felt my cock stiffening and Alison and Jardine noticed too and Alison grabbed me and said, "Don't feel embarrassed. She's young and good, and you're a man with full desire. Why not enjoy it?" She brushed her hand against my trousers to indicate her appreciation too, and Fi smiled at her. "He is good, too" Fi murmured, "and if you want to help him pee or cum, I won't mind; though he's got me pretty wet with his spunk at times!"

Sylphide's parents were not bad either; June had long red trousers and a white top; her dad, Paul, wore a golfing top and shorts. His cock was fairly limp as he pumped out his waters and June simply dropped her trousers and pants and squatted on the edge to empty herself. Margaret did much the same and then Grace, this smart, bright, eighty plus woman, hitched up the hem of her smart blue medium length skirt, stood over the trough and peed out a long stream of silver. By golly, she was good! And she earned herself a massive round of applause from the onlookers which she acknowledged with a curtsey!

Terry whispered "she must have been quite something in her time", obviously far too loudly, because she replied quite sharply, "I'll have you know, young man, this is my time. I have been here nine times in the past six years and every time has been better than the one before! I enjoy my bladder and I enjoy seeing others savour the moment and the people around them. Getting wet in a free atmosphere is the best you can get. I shall expect you to take one of my forfeits for that remark!"

I said to Fi, "What forfeits?" To which she replied, "She'll pee on him later, probably after supper tonight, and let him taste what a fantastic woman she is! She did it to me once when I made a similar mistake to him, and I have never forgotten the moment."

Chapter 15 - Monday Evening. The House Party Banquet

By 8.30 we had got washed, dressed and we went downstairs. Fi led me across the yard to the stables. Adjoining them, was a large low barn, around the edge of which had been laid tables and a rich aroma of good food wafted about. Good food, good wine, good company. And rather good entertainment too!

Our hosts welcomed us and very warmly welcomed me especially. I rather gathered that Fi was very special to them. (And these months later, she's very special to me too.) After we had taken our places and a starter served, we talked to the people around and across the tables and found out who was from where and how they'd heard about the party, who had invited them, what they hoped for. Jill was on our table, together with two ladies we didn't yet know and Nick.

The main course was fish, and when they too had been served, Brandon spoke to the assembled company. He started by saying how pleased he and Angela and Sam and Patrick were to have us sharing a pee party with them, and then he went on, "Most people get bored on a wet weekend; we on the other hand are going to have the best wet week you have ever known, and lots of fun as well." There were giggles of approval, then, "We do have a few ground-rules which for the sake of the newcomers, I will repeat.

Firstly, you all know that pee has it's own peculiar smell. That's why we get you all to pee out most of the impurities you have picked up during the day on the way here, almost before you get inside. We also provide masses of juices, wine, water, beer, cider and lager and we expect you all to drink at least four litres a day and hopefully come back for more. Then when your gold and silver streams leave your body, the juice will be attractive and often quite palatable."

At this juncture Angela took over, «Unfashionable though it is in 21st Century Britain, all four of us happen to believe that this world didn't come about by accident or evolution. We actually believe in a loving God who made designed us and everything in the world. That's why we don't have parties on a Sunday - we often attend church, although many of our friends in the congregation would be more than amazed by our interests - so we don't tell them!

«Rejoice with us in our common humanity. We think that sex is great and wet sex even better. It should be fun though we also happen to think that it is best when shared between two people. One night stands and irregular sex may be entertaining for the moment, but can lead to you feeling lost and dissatisfied when you need to do it again and your last partner has moved on.

«So this week will also be about building relationships with your partners and with all of us who are here. We think rather differently from most people, in that everything we do, eating, shopping, sport, watching films, washing up, working, sex and peeing, can be celebrated with others, and not separated out into what's acceptable to law and our society which is, after all, quite different from others.

###

Sam introduced herself here. "Most of you know that Angela, and I and Brandon and Patrick live together in the private part of the house. We love one another equally but believe that sex is for just one couple. You must also obey that rule. If you are intent on having sex, you must do so only with the partner you brought with you unless you have met for the first time here in which case you must stick with them for all the time you are here. Whatever you may do elsewhere, here we have that rule so that no jealousies spring up and destroy our times together. Anyone breaking the rule will be asked to leave.

"On the other hand, you may, if given permission by another person, help them to cum. That is allowed and often practised in our experience. You may also have sex with your partner anywhere in the grounds and buildings but be aware that this may not be in private. In fact I shall be surprised if you do nor see at least three couples at it over your time here. You will almost certainly learn new ways to pleasure your partner.»

Angela came back at this point, «Before we continue with the evening's entertainment and remembering that water is the basis for all that will 'pass' here, we must warn you that there are several pools dotted around the fields, of which by far the biggest one is near to the house. It is surrounded by trees and on a fine day can be a magical place. However, the water is deep and you must accept that you are responsible for your staying safe. If you drink much alcohol don't go near the pond. There are life rings and an emergency phone at the northern end. But be careful please! But above all this is to be a celebration of peeing. Enjoy your own flow by all means, but enjoy everyone else's too! Enjoy the sights, the smells, the taste. Enjoy your wet clothes, whether you have wet yourself, or someone has wet them for you.»

«A word of warning here. It can be dangerous to drink to excess and especially drinking and holding for a long time without eating as well. It can lead to the medical condition, 'water intoxication' which has been known to be fatal. So you must take care. If you have drunk a lot without food and start to feel dizzy you must stop drinking, take some food and rest up. If someone is taken ill it could jeopardise this and any subsequent parties. That is why at any area we may be playing in, there will always be food on hand as well as liquids. Please enjoy yourselves safely.

(«Actually as we are all perfectly normal human beings who love our food we will need to go to the toilet. Let me reassure you that this is a perfectly natural, normal and necessary thing. In Western society using the toilet is a taboo and very secretive practice; in warmer climates and many other places it is not like that. It is not unusual to see men or women relieving themselves outdoors and that is not regarded as objectionable.

In ancient Rome, such communal areas were provided in a square facing one another, with lots of holes for people to squat over. It wasn't regarded as bad, but as a social activity. We have lost a lot of our civilization by becoming civilized. Here we do not subscribe to those restrictive Western practices and we have four very special outdoor public latrines about the place. These are sited between the arms of the house. You are encouraged to use them if possible or there are facilities in all the rooms as well. They are deliberately open to view and are a marvel of self-sustaining engineering and anything put into them will eventually help to produce the food that we serve here.)

«Now, has anyone has a pee whilst sitting here?» Three women and two men put their hands up. Angela continued,"I recognise all of you have been here before. I'll guarantee everyone here of you will piss out loads between now and midnight. But be aware, because stale pee does go off rapidly, even if it is highly diluted, we always hose this area and the other concreted zones each night. If any of you make a puddle either by accident or design in your rooms, we would be very grateful if, after your passion has subsided, you would mop it away. Mops and buckets are in all the rooms. In the soil and grass areas it doesn't matter - you'll just be direct contributors to our land.

"Now drink up and let the partying begin as soon as the main course has finished. Sweets and coffee are served outside tonight as it is a fine warm evening."

Shortly after this introduction, music wafted through the air. A huge variety from classical to Celtic, rap to opera. Something for everyone. People started to dance, to talk, to discuss quite heatedly at times until about a hour after the end of the meal, bladders were getting very full and needed emptying.

Dressed in her favourite tight jeans Jill came up to me and said «This is exciting, isn't it?» In reply I simply pulled out my cock and shot a long stream out in a massive arc towards her, splashing her legs. She was effusive in her thanks and I watched with delight as her pee soaked into her jeans as she wet herself again just like on that first day. Then she went back to the party, promising we would meet up again.

By the time I got back to the centre, I'd lost sight of Fi for a while but saw her talking to the family from Devon. As I approached, June pumped out a stream of pale gold

, which splashed onto Fi's legs and his feet. It was obvious Fi was in her element, and, standing slightly back, she put her finger to her pussy, and altered the angle of her outlet. Then she pissed a jet which was 45 degrees or higher. The hem of June's light blue skirt turned a darker shade and I heard her say, "Oh my!, That's really good. Thanks."

I joined them and Fi gave me a kiss and a hug and I said, "I need more liquid. Lager - I need a long, cold lager, maybe several! My bladder had to be emptied and now I can't take part in this festival."

"Of course you can," she said, "after you've had a drink with me, see if you can find someone to pee on you, or some lady you can use those skilled fingers on. Look at Jardine over there - if ever I saw a woman needing relief it's her. And she hasn't got Terry with her. Go and help her out!"

I looked at the her and I agreed with Fi's assessment. Drinking back the lager faster than was probably wise, I got another and went over to her. "Hello, Jardine, you look a bit unhappy, anything I can do?" She looked at me and said, "Terry's gone off somewhere and I feel so sexy watching all this going on (she waved her hands to encompass the whole area)"

I sat beside her on the low wall and said, "Fi thinks I could help you. Would you like me to do that?" Her dynamic response was to move my hand down so that I pushed the elastic of her skirt down to reveal her pussy. She spread her legs and pulled the waistband further down so that I could slide my fingers into her slit.

She was a dry as the ground and would need a lot of help to be able to come. "Why don't you piss a bit?" I suggested; "that'll help with lubrication." She sighed like a gentle breeze and I heard the hiss of a jet of water and felt its warmth. Holding my hand against the flow I directed it back onto her clit and vagina. "Is that enough?" she asked. "I don't want to waste any."

"It's fine", I replied, and gently began to massage her. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Fi and Jill approaching, the latter carrying a tray of drinks. She looked on approvingly as Jardine began to build up a charge and then came in an explosive yell that quite startled us. "Wow", she said, "Thanks - you're good!" She took a glass of juice from Jill, and I had another and then one more; I had got thirsty doing all that work!

Jardine said, "Let me sit on your lap and water you as a thank-you present." I sat square to the wall, and she positioned herself on my lap. I could have easily slid inside her and no one would have known. Instead I felt the comforting warmth seeping through my shorts. It was ecstasy for a few minutes, then it cooled in the night air, and my cock went limp. Jill started to talk with Jardine and Fi and I walked back together to the patio.

Returning to the patio, we saw there were snacks and more liquids. I mixed myself a long litre of fruit juice and drank it right off. Then had another cold lager. It was getting on for 11.00pm by this time, but I could have at least one more piss before the party was over. Three of the women were standing on a table, and as I looked on they beckoned me over. "We've been discussing everyone, and we reckon you're the best thing that's happened here since Fi and the Dobbins' started this thing."

I said, "And Sylphide. She's young, not innocent, but willing to learn. She'll take this thing to new heights in a few years. But I hadn't realised Fi was a founder member."

«Coo, I need a pee," said one of them suddenly, and good to her word, I watched as her jeans darkened. Triggered by that another simply dropped her skirt and squatted over the table revealing a delicately shaved pussy with a simple triangle of fur and a tight slit, from which a curve of gold streamed forth forming a large pool of nectar on the table-top. Not to be outdone, the third woman, dropped her trousers, stepped out of them, jumped to the ground and came over to me. "Put your hand in my crotch", she ordered. Doing so I felt her stream a warming flow over me. "Cup your hands in the flow, and then drink!" she directed. I did so, and found she tasted sweet, like apples and strawberries pur�ed together. "Is it good?" she asked. "Fantastic"! I replied. "Oh good, I have drunk only water and apple and strawberry juices all day. Now I know it works, I'll try a different mix tomorrow."

"What's you name?" I asked. "Thomasina", was the reply. "And your table friends?"

"Natasha and Beryl - they call us The Three W's - as all our last names begin with a W. Why don't you come and stand on the table and we'll stand on the ground? Then you can water us. We would all like a golden shower." By now I was full enough, slightly tipsy and feeling horny enough to do it. I'd lost sight of Fi somewhere, but the W's stood and looked up at me as I released my cock and spurted my fluid at them. They got soaked on their tops and it ran down their legs or trousers as one had put hers back on. Finishing with a flourish there a huge cheer went up from most of the guests.

They had seen what was happening whilst I had been so engrossed, and were delighted by my performance. Seeing Fi in the front row I asked, "Don't you mind? When can we get to be just the two of us?"

"I'm afraid it will be about 1.00am", Fi answered. "I always help the Dobbins to get things ready for the next day."

"Oh well, I shall just have to go on getting and giving pleasure in public. Are you sure you don't mind?"

"No, I don't mind, Mr Morton, just keep filling up that tank of yours and I should be able to quench my thirst from your tap sometime soon."

So that's what I did for the remainder of the evening. I took great satisfaction from watching the regulars as they knew how much of what would get them full. I was also fascinated by the way some of them had prepared. Young Terry had trousers with two zips which meant that he could remove a panel from the crotch. That meant that he could both empty himself and take his partner Jardine without taking off his clothes. More exciting was the young single woman Alison A, who wore an short nylon skirt. When she peed, and I saw her several times that evening, there was a sort of aura around her. I learned later that she was a physics graduate and she had built small light diodes around the top of the garment! What a girl!

Fi probably came to our room sometime after 1.00am, but I had had to call it a day by midnight. There had been a lot of excitement and a lot of fresh air in a very short while and as some of the others drifted off to bed, I concluded that if I was going to get the best out of Thursday, I needed some sleep.

Chapter 16 - Tuesday 2nd August� A Full Day's Pee Party

I woke at 4.30am with Fi beside me and my bladder screaming for relief. I slid out of my side of the bed and made for the bathroom door. Fi said, "Don't go in there - go off the balcony."

"Didn't know you were awake, love, but why not? It's certainly less restrictive." So that's what I did, and it must have taken a full 90 seconds to empty my bladder.

At about 7.15 I awoke with a full bladder and a hard-on. As I stirred Fi did so too, and she felt my cock under the bed clothes. «You need a fuck or a piss; which first?» Without waiting, she slid over me and as she did so her pussy felt wet. «You just come?», I asked. «No», she answered, «but I have had a pee dribble.» I slid my rock-hard cock up to her opening at which point she wet herself and me again. «What about the bedding?» I asked. «»That's no problem - wet beds are just part of the fun here and they change them every day if necessary.» I pushed on in and thrust and thrust expecting to come, but my bladder was so full I couldn't fire. She slid me out and turning came down on me with her mouth sucking and licking; I let my piss start to flow and she just drank a little and let more onto the sheets. And then I came and she licked me clean, swallowing it all. «I adore that taste», she said.

###

Jardine and Terry who were in the room below ours, came up to us at breakfast. Jardine said, "I couldn't sleep after 4.30 and sat on the patio outside - it was such a warm morning. Then it started to rain. The ground was bone dry and then I looked up because the dawn was cloudless, and there I could see the tip of your cock and a droplets of pee which were falling on me!" I must have looked shell-shocked, but Terry took up the story. "Not to worry old thing, we here to enjoy one another's peeing aren't we? It was just unexpected, but very enjoyable for Jardine. Please, do it as much as you like during the days we are here."

The day's entertainment was set out on a notice pinned up near the breakfast tables. It turned out there were two types of distance competitions. One was a timed thing. Each contestant had to present themselves at a specific time, four at a time, and to send their waters as far as they could in a straight line. The winners of the three heats would compete again the next day. The other type was that anyone could keep filling until they couldn't wait any more; go and find two of the judges, and ask for a measurement to be made as they peed.

We spent the time up till lunch doing whatever we chose. It would be a long evening! In the afternoon filling started in earnest and I walked round and took shots of every form of human relief that was going on and a few very tasteful pictures of two couples as they were linked together.

Come the evening and the primary contests took place. Watching the three W's and Margaret in one heat and Alison J , June, Jill, Sylphide and Jardine in another that evening in the distance trials. Nick, Terry, John and Paul were the only men and John was the outright male winner at 3.78m. It was then that I discovered that if a woman squatted and leant back, and used one hand to spread her lips, she could send a jet of gold yards out from her body. That was quite a revelation and a turn-on.

Alison A would join Alison J in the pee-off on Friday evening having gone over 4m! Plus the longest runner-up John.

As we all interacted the talk was of competition, and many wanted to know why I wasn't taking part. "I guess I thought I'd just observe and photograph this time" was my usual reply. Later Fi steered me away from the company and said, "Alex, why don't you take part in the free distance if nothing else? These people really have taken to you." I replied, «Well, I have leaked in front of some of them, y'know.»

"Then at least let them see you peeing some more! They like you. In fact not only did I invite you here and want to show you to my friends, I was fascinated what sort of impression you would make. Now I know; even in this short time they all love you passionately. Half the ladies want to fuck you, and all the men want to ask you where you learnt how to piss with such style!"

"Crumbs", I responded. "I hadn't a clue about that. Aren't you afraid I'll slip up or go off with someone else?"

"Not for a moment. The W's are right you know, we make a great team." So for the remainder of the week whenever I peed, I always made sure I had an audience.
