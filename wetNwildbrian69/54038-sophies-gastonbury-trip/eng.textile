A total fantasy, nothing in this story is real.

Glastonbury adventure, seen through the eyes of Sophie:

It was a sultry warm June evening in Glastonbury. There had not been much rain this year, but the festival was still wet. Very wet. For a start there were only a few portaloos and even fewer that worked. The campsite had pretty much become a free for all where the combination drink, soft drugs and lack of sleep meant that inhibitions had vanished. Many times on the way through the camp I had happened across a girl squatting down outside her tent. The squats were all very similar, as if they all attended the same peeing-outdoors training before they came.

Trousers were bunched up on top of the wellies, knees bent and bum swung down near the ground so a good steady stream could arc forward before hitting the ground. There was no self-consciousness just a basic practicality, answering the call of nature before getting back into the tent. On top of a mountain this would pass without comment - the difference here was that thousands of people were just milling about. The practical brazenness of it turned me on.

There was to be more that night, much more than I could have expected. I like to see a woman pee, I also like to see desperate scenes and I really like to witness a sneaky pee. This night was not going to disappoint. I made my way over to one of the side stages, the one where Shania was to play. She was to be followed by Avril, that beautiful, blond bouncy chick that hung out with skateboarders. Things had changed at Glastobury. Ever since Rolf Harris had played the main stage the crowd was more willing to hear different music and - even if it didn't make the main stage - bubble gum pop, skater and country would all now find a willing audience.

In recent years this festival had become more corporate - the music cognoscenti preferred to go to other events such as Download or Latitude. On this occasion the corporate sponsors could not have expected to see what I saw.

My night started well. I stood in the crowd - packed in - watching some of the warm up acts. Every so often around me I spotted guys holding beer bottles under their coats. It was obvious what they did to refill them before they tipped the contents onto the ground. Sometimes I could glimpse the tip of a dick pressed against the bottle opening, carefully aimed, with a strategic gap left to let the displaced air out. It's easy for guys I thought - they can whip it out and people would hardly know what was going on.

All at once I noticed the crowd opening up in front of me, forming a loose circle. I moved in closer to see what was going on. Luckily I am quite tall and could see over the shoulder of the person in front. She formed part of the outer cordon. As I looked over her I could see two girls with their jeans and pants down. They weren't squatting but leaning backwards facing the sky, straining in a crab like pose. They pushed their hips upwards, feet and hands on the ground. At first, I couldn't see that they were peeing but I knew they were.

They had adopted an odd position but one that meant I could see the front of their shaven pussies. Their legs were together hiding anything more interesting. Even ten feet away I could hear the hissing as their pee forced between closed legs and I thought I heard it splash onto the grass. Since they were closed, I could see little pools of piss forming on the tops of their legs, and I took delight in imagining how it felt as the warmth forced itself between their thighs and fingered along their leg-backs shaded from the fading spring sun and brisk, cooling breeze, forming rivulets before dropping dripping and sploshing to the ground.

I had time before the main act so set out to find somewhere to relieve the pressure that had been building up inside of me. I thought about just staying where I was and wetting my jeans, but decided against it as I wanted to save that for later. I made my way to the right hand side of the crowd, gently pushing through. When I got to the edge I found my way towards the front outside the barriers - I was challenged only once, my eyes flashed a pretty smile from behind my blond fringe. I said I was desperate for a pee. I crossed my ankles, pushed my hand into my crotch and dipped and bent forward for good measure. He let me through.

When I got to the front towards the side of the stage I found metal barrier and a security guard. I saw his radio earpiece, and noticed how bored he looked so I sidled up to him and smiled. Look I said, I am a real big Shania fan, any chance I could get to see her up close. Perhaps there by the edge of the stage? «No way miss, sorry». As he was talking I performed my pee dip again, and noticed how his expression changed. «Hey you look like you need to pee real bad, what's your name?». I told him my name and confirmed, yes I was really becoming quite desperate.

«Look Sophie, you seem like a nice girl. If you were to get close would you behave?» I answered him promising I would. «OK, if you let me watch you pee - you can get in». OK I said - you let me get on the other side of the fence, and I'll let you watch.

With the fence between us, I unbuttoned my jeans and slid them and my knickers down. I reached forward, grabbed hold of two of the vertical bars of the fence and swung down hanging on, with feet facing the guard. I had learned he was called Brian. I peed a strong stream - it went forward almost reaching his boots . He stood and watched. I saw the bulge grow under his uniform. I felt turned on by the idea I might be a caged exhibit in his private museum.

Now I was in and I made my way to the side of the stage, just in time to see Shania start her show. She was beautiful. Tall with perfect makeup and long brunette shoulder length hair. Her long, slim arms were bare and she wore a tight one-piece black creation constructed like a cat suit. The top part formed what looked like a waist coat, low cut neckline showing more than cleavage, it plunged below the bottom of her large, pert breasts showing their full form. She wore a big Texan-style belt buckle which hid the source of a long, wide, silver-metal zipper starting under her belt, near her belly button, and curved around, through her legs, over her bum and ended at the back of her dress - around the small of her back. Wow, I thought, that must be difficult to get out of. Boy she made me feel like a woman.

She paused in the wings, the band started to play, the backing singers (only a few feet from me) broke into a doo-wap harmony. Then with an explosion of energy she broke into a huge smile, showing perfect white teeth and her cute dimpled nose. With a skipping run she bounced out on to the stage. She started the first number waving to the cheering crowd. At the end she took a huge swallow from a water bottle on the stage - «Hello England» she cried, echoing from the amplified stage mics. She was rocking, «How Y'all doing? It's great to be here, you ready to rock?». Another swallow and the high energy set was off to a good start.

I always wondered what happened if she needed to go when on stage - how could she keep tune? My curiosity was answered soon when Shania was deep into a rocking solo and I noticed one of the backing singers squatting down, lifting her skirt, pulling her pants to the side and taking a sneaky pee. She was out of the view of the audience, hidden by a monitor amp - but I saw. She was quick, very quick, like a marathon runner taking relief without losing a moment of time. A small puddle formed on the sage and trickled down towards me.

Well that's OK for them I thought, but what about Shania - she could hardly pop a squat like that, could she? By the fifth number I thought I could see the tell-tale signs of urgency building. And then I found out her secret. She came to the front of the stage, crouched down and reached out the crowd. They were singing along, and she was pointing the microphone towards them. I had always thought that this move, common in many acts I had seen, was to help «connect» with the fans. But now I saw, from where I was I could see that she was making little squirts, forcing little splashes through that crotch zipper. She wasn't fully peeing but she was letting off pressure. So that's how she managed this long act.

At the end of her set (which had included almost all of my favourite tracks) she waved to the crowd, «Thank you England�.» Grabbed a towel and started off the stage, walking right up to me. «Come on Hun, I need your help», she took my elbow and guided me down the back steps of the stage. «Quick», she said,» I can't hold it much longer - you'll have to help me out of this suit». We hurried through the temporary dressing rooms and burst into hers. It was an open plan dressing room, with a sink, toilet , exercise bike, clothes rail and a sitting area. There were no walls but the toilet was semi hidden by the clothes rail. Not as glamorous as I had expected, but functional. We were not alone.

Sat on the white porcelain pan was another girl. Her skin was almost as white as the toilet, her hair was dyed blond with roots showing. She wore bright red lipstick, dark heavy eye shadow around her piercing green eyes. Avril sat there, her dress hitched up and her small panties at her ankles. The lacy white waist band was stretched between her kitten heel boot and the gusset waved loosely up and towards us. Her pussy was well groomed but not shaved. It confirmed she was not a natural blond. She opened her legs, smiled at us (twice) and we saw clearly her stream and heard it hiss out of her and explode into the water beneath.

I had to take this in quickly as I was urgently encouraged to help Shania out of her cat suit. As my hand guided the zipper down her back and through her legs I felt the last drops of the wetness that I had witnessed earlier. She was agitated and couldn't wait any longer. She scampered to the waste basket, squatted and let loose her golden rain, the crackling of the liquid against the stiff plastic bag liner sounded like a roll of thunder approaching.

That show was great, brought a hole new meaning to access all areas ! What a night.

To celebrate I wrote a new verse for her song, I hope one day she'll sing it to me:

I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart

But you've got pissing, down to an art.

You think you're a genius, you piss up the wall

You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Oh-oo-oh, you think you pee 's so special

Oh-oo-oh, you think you pee something else

Well that makes me press so much

So you feel the pain but do you feel the push?

- Perhaps you can help me add some more verses?
