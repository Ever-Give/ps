As you can probably imagine, my adventure with Lisa had filled me with mixed emotions in the weeks and months following our successful business transaction.

There were times when I questioned whether the rather large cash sum I had handed over was actually value for money. Then, whenever I found myself in a dark room at night, lying alone, I knew that I would do it again in an instant! The thrill of the silent observance on that magical afternoon, the smell, touch and feel of her soft white delicate flesh, and the rattling drum of her pale green stream hitting the pool beneath her, were revisited time and again in the living colour of perfect recall.

It's also true to say that life around the office was more than a little awkward after the event.

Not for her though, Lisa's ice cool detachment was commendable. The arrangement had been that there was to be no reaction between us, before or after, no acknowledgement of what had happened and certainly no follow up. I had watched her pee, and paid the money. She had cleared her debt and life went on.

For my part, I found it far less easy to remain impassive. My heart skipped a beat every time I found Lisa about to cross my path, behind me in a queue for the water cooler, or whenever I just saw her name on an e mail distribution. I flushed red and slurred my words like a drunk on the very rare occasions when we actually had to exchange words.

So it was a very peculiar feeling one quiet Tuesday when a colleague casually mentioned that he'd heard that Lisa was leaving the company. She was half way through a month's notice before taking up a senior PA position for a large merchant bank in the city.

On one hand I felt that this would be a blessed relief. No more flustered embarrassment, no more burning frustration at seeing her perfect body shimmying around the place. On the other, I felt rather sad that such a central part of my sexual fulfilment would be fully and finally in the past. Would I quickly forget her sweet face, forced to rely on an ever decreasing memory of what she even looked like whenever I needed to rely upon it to ease the tension of a moment?

Over the next couple of weeks I longed for some little sign from her just to recognize that something had indeed happened between us. But it didn't come. She continued to ignore my very existence.

There was an open invitation to attend a leaving drink at a nearby club. I didn't go, it would have been too painful, and despite her aloof demeanour, I suspect she would have found my presence somewhat difficult, despite her well practiced indifference.

On the day of her leaving there was a gathering around her workstation as soon to be ex colleagues kissed cheeks and offered small gifts as tokens of their affection. She was a very popular girl.

Once again I kept my distance, watching from the back of the crowd as I searched in vain for even a glance in my general direction.

As she pulled on her coat against the chill and left the office for the very last time I took a lingering look at her face to register her perfect features for a final time and consigned Lisa to permanent history.

Or so I thought!

She had been gone just ten minutes when the buzz of my phone registered an incoming message.

«Hello its me Lisa. Thanks for all your discretion since you know when. I know we agreed that we would carry on as if it never happened, but I know how hard that was for you (no pun intended lol), and I could sense your problem with that. - Anyway you got me over a difficult position back then and you should know how grateful I am for that. I could never risk having this conversation while I was working in the same place as you but I guess now its ok. Meet me at 5.30 at the Red Lion, I've got a little proposition for you - love and kisses».

To say that I was bowled over is to understate my reaction on the grandest scale. Rather than miss beats my little heart nearly burst through my chest. My palms and brow sweated up and I found myself walking aimlessly down the corridor just trying to burn adrenalin. All this time, the cold, or rather frigid stand offs. I had been totally convinced of her complete disdain for me and what I had done, just assuming that she had dismissed my fantasy as a creepy perversion. I hadn't blamed her for that, but nothing I could do would change me. But now, in a couple of simple lines, she had conveyed her gratitude and, dare I even think it, had even made a friendly approach.

I was incapable of rational thought as I furtively entered the Red Lion - spot on time. What was to come?

Lisa was ensconced in a little alcove with a tall pink drink in front of her. She caught my eye and I slid into the faux leather bench seat next to her. I didn't speak.

Lisa took a sip of her cocktail and looked into my eyes over the rim, lashes long and lush as a warm smile crossed her lips.

«Bet this is a bit of shock eh?» - Her first real conversation since the big day.

«Er you c-could say that yeah» I stammered nervously.

«Look just try to calm down. I can understand what's going on in your head - the psychology I mean - I actually looked it up, its called voyeurism» (as if I didn't know!) - «I can see why the concealment was important and I actually thought ignoring you would add to the thrill, even though it was necessary».

«Hmmm�.» I remained tight lipped.

«As I said, you got me out of trouble and I really appreciate it. And now that I can understand your head, I really think we can be good for each other. I have to go now, but I want you to come to my flat at exactly 7 o'clock Friday morning before work, I'll explain everything then».

With that she handed me a little personal address card, got up, leaned forward and kissed me lightly on the cheek. She downed her drink in one and disappeared into the cool evening air without even waiting for me to reply.

I ordered and stiff scotch and stared vacantly ahead - I had said nothing more.

The next two days were restless as I watched the clock go round. I slept fitfully but when Friday morning came I was up and alert, still fuelled up on adrenalin.

Lisa's flat was on the first floor of a city centre modern block. She had to buzz me up from the street and I tried to stay collected as she opened her front door sheepishly to let me in.

«Thanks for coming» she said quietly, as if I was there to give her music lessons!

She poured me a coffee and sat me down at the kitchen island. She was dressed to go out, even though she wasn't due to start her new job until the following Monday.

I plucked up the courage, looked about me and initiated a conversation for the first ever time.

«Gosh it feels so strange being in here, I always wondered how you lived, that's what an obsessive interest in a person does».

«I guess!» she acknowledged.

I could smell her fragrance, freshly applied, and her pink low cut top shaped her breasts and dipped where her bra dug in. Her ash blonde hair hung in a long silky bob.

I chanced a question, swallowing hard, «So dare I ask why I'm here?»

«As I said, I want to show my gratitude and to describe an interesting opportunity to you, come with me».

She clasped my hand and led me into a narrow corridor and pushed open a side door off.

I found myself standing in her bathroom. Gleaming white designer tiles to both floor and walls, shelves and a vanity unit bedecked with girly items. It could never be a man's bathroom. It had female ambience pouring from every niche, sweeping over me, creating an intoxicating sensation of lust and enchantment.

I looked at her, and then glanced over to the low level toilet suite, wondering what was to happen next. My head was exploding.

She noticed. «I do believe I've got you interested you nasty little man» she giggled playfully.

«This is what I was thinking�.» she began - letting go the grip on my hand as it sweated unpleasantly.

«You see I start my new job on Monday, but I don't actually get paid for two months. You can imagine that that's given me a little cash flow problem, especially as I've said yes to a very expensive ski trip with a group of girls from work in just four weeks from now».

«Okaaaay.. so where do I come in?»

«Look over behind you»- she nodded over my shoulder to the opposite corner of the room and I turned to see a built in store cupboard with a polished hardwood louvre door.

Lisa pushed past me and swung open the door. The cupboard was completely empty, save for a little stool. On the inside of the door frame was a small brass push bolt.

«You see this little bolt here» purred Lisa, running her long white fingers across it and slipping it back and forth. «This discourages any visitors from having a nosy peek inside».

«But its on the inside» I returned, how do you lock it from the outside?»

«Well obviously I can't», she replied, «but you could, - that is - if you were in there already».

My tummy flipped over.

«And you see.., it's just that all the girls on the trip are coming over tomorrow night for drinks and nibbles and a final prep for the weekend away». If you were to see your way to being generous with my air fare, I'm sure I could let you climb inside here before anyone arrives».

She fluttered her eyes seductively and pushed her body close to me. I gulped hard as the wave of anticipation swept through me.

My voice went up two octaves, «who's coming?» I squeaked, almost inaudibly.

Lisa turned her back and started reeling off names, counting on her fingers, - a who's who of the most stunning collection of fit young women from across all departments at work. Twelve of them in total.

«What d'you think?» she asked me, - I didn't hesitate for the merest moment.

«yes yes yes» I spluttered, «you know exactly what that would do to me Lisa .. thank you thank you..»

«No - thank you» she replied, its Seven Hundred Pounds».

That brought the business arrangement sharply into focus but I didn't care, it was the price of a dream - again!

The following day time seemed to stand still as I watched the clock down to the appointed hour.

At six I jumped into the car and drove the short distance accross town to Lisa's flat.

« How did I know you'd be nice and early» she grinned as I slipped past her in the open doorway. I noticed her take a quick look left and right, no doubt checking that no-one noticed my entrance, not that it need necessarily have aroused suspicion.

Inside, the well appointed flat was set out for a drinks and buffet party. The lights were dimmed and a small table was well filled with an attractive array of finger food.

There was soft jazz flowing from expensive speakers to complete the atmosphere of upwardly mobile sophistication.

I paid little attention to all that however. It was Lisa herself who simply overwhelmed my senses. She was dressed in a chic little black cocktail dress, just above the knee, strapless and cinched at the waist. Her hair was shining and her long brown legs were set off by an expensive pair of black strappy heels. Around her neck a simple white gold chain and drop pendant. Her flawless skin gleamed and the tiny dimples in her cheeks deepened as she smiled seductively.

«So I guess we've got about twenty minutes to work in a bit of safety margin» she said thoughtfully. «Do you need to err.. freshen up first?»

The nerves were getting to me. «Probably a good idea» I conceded shyly. «Do you mind»

«Go ahead - case the joint», - and with that she opened the door to the bathroom. I closed the door and gazed around the room, the scented air was all so feminine. I rubbed my crotch almost unconciously as the butterflies welled up in a flourish of anticipation. Then I pulled open the door to the cupboard. Inside was the little red stool, a bottle of water and small selection of her party food. And, how considerate, a box of Kleenex! On the stool was a small yellow post it note. «Be very careful - no heavy breathing, no sudden movements and no moans! - Have fun - L. XX".

I emerged from the batroom to find Lisa standing right outside biting her knuckle. «Is everything OK?» It was like she was seeking approval!

«Its perfect» - «Can I go in now?»

She followed me back inside and I clambered into the open cupboard, pulled the door closed and slipped the bolt fast.

Outside, Lisa stooped and bent back and forth, trying to see if there was any angle at which she could see me. «It's great» she cried, raising her voice, «I can't see anything but darkness».

«No need to shout» I replied « I'm only a few inches away».

At that she said more quietly, «Oh God what am I doing?» again nervously chewing at her hand. «OK!! - seven hundred quid and a ski trip. Lets do it - I'll be back in a minute».

She left the room, leaving the light on behind her. Then I realised what a superb vantage point she'd given me. Through the angled slats of the door I could see the whole room, from the door accross to the vanity unit, mirror and shower, and at about sixty degrees, a front side view of the toilet, at about six feet away. The bright light reflected and highlighted every feature in high definition opalescence.

I drank it all in and as I settled into my seat, the door pushed open. I saw Lisa appear and her heels clicked accross the tiles as she turned to face me, her back to the loo. She reached to her side and slid the clinging dress up her nut brown thighs, to reveal the tiny triangle of black satin panties beneath. She pushed them down to her knees and I caught the faintest glimpse of soft brown pubic strip before she spread her knees leaned forward on her elbows and jetted a hot stream of piss rattling into the pan.

I only had an occaisional glimpse of pee as her hair hung forward in the line of vision, but oh, the pose! The intimicacy of this private moment happening right in front of me was almost too much and I ripped open my jeans. She tailed off and grabbed some tissue, tossing her hair back and half straightening to wipe betwen her tender lips, which protruded in the gap between her legs. Not once did she acknowledge my presence, she knew that my fetish was all about concealment - watching what I could never be allowed to see in everyday life.

She slowly hoisted her panties back up her legs, giving me a slightly lingering view of her lower tummy and down through the freshly waxed lines to her neat, nipped up pubic mound. She reached around into the cleft of her cheeks to straighten the string behind before flicking her dress forward and down to pat and smooth it back into place to the front and back.

She sidestepped to the basin, ran water over her finger tips and wiped them on the towel over the rail.

With that, she ran her fingers through her hair, pouted in the mirror and turned to leave.

As the light went out and the door closed, I was left in silent darkness to wait for the door bell to ring, the party to start and to count the minutes till a parade of beatiful sexy young girls felt that they just had to take a pee!
