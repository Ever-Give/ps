Wednesday 30th April

Arrived at him to find him in the village. Returned his mended printer and then waited for him. He came at 7, and then we left at 7.30. He seemed to have recovered from the trip to the south last week.

He had returned from the pub and had no doubt had a few drinks. As he'd only been away less than an hour I assumed he'd «necked' at least two pints and not broken the seal yet. This was the norm for him these days but then spend the rest of the evening at home doing other stuff. I had seen him walk all the way from the pub up to his house, and there wasn't anywhere on the way to stop to «admire the view» mostly due to the amount of people nearby or walking near him. All he needed would have taken less than a minute.

Half of that checking the «coast was clear' then the remainder shoving himself into the hedge and easing off the pressure a bit. I was sure if he knew I was at his place he would have made more of an effort. But he didn't. As soon as he arrived at the house, as well as being surprised to see me at all, I told him I had squared it with his folks to go for a drive as he had the coach for college the next morning at 6am, he nipped in quickly and I followed. I think he had intended to goto the toilet but as I was at the doorway he glanced up, saw me, uttered a few words in Welsh to his parents and then slipped out of the door and moments later we were leaving in the car. He had already demonstrated his impressive bladder capacity so I guessed he figured he could manage.

We drove out of the village on the main road towards town. He had a can of draught bitter, and was gagging for some fags. He moaned he was desperate. Despite his age the local shop wouldn't sell him any plus his parents would find out, which they didn't like. As he smoked about 15 a day, he had not had one since lunchtime and was going up the wall! By the time I arrived on the outskirts of the town he had finished the can. I pulled in at the Spar at the top village in the town and parking outside slipped in for them. I saw him on the security camera outside, he got out and looked around but only moved from view briefly, there were too many people around to do anything else. When I went outside he was standing near the back of the car

«You ok?» I asked, he looked up. He was looking around to the other shops and their side entrance. I knew what he wanted

«Yeah, just getting some air�» he replied

«Ok» We climbed back in and drove on. Immediately he opened the window, lit up and descended into bliss. He didn't want another can yet and was strangely quiet, but I encouraged him and mentioned he was slow tonight. I knew it was something he didn't like being told so dutifully opened the can and sloshed it down his neck, downing at least � before coming up for air, and even then he soon finished that can.

That would have a direct route to his bladder, which I guessed was already pretty full! I drove out on Tany Beach, he asked me not to, he wasn't feeling up to it but I did anyway. The first half was badly rutted with rocks and stones but the latter half up to the end was smoothed over as if the waves from the sea had cleaned it.

However, if the sea had reached this far the nearby town would have been flooded too.. He was strangely quiet all the way and sucked harder on the narcotic, until we emerged on the other side and he groaned, almost in relief. Quietly. However his face betrayed the pain that had repeatedly flashed over it at the bumps as the car had gently bumped and lurched. Gently for me, with him feeling every inflamed nerves, not necessarily. His legs were open and his seatbelt loose again around his midsection. As we passed back into the streetlights by the harbour his hand moved from his groin where his bulge showed, he must have given it a quick reassuring squeeze, where thanks more to hormones than aching bladder it had engorged a bit

I drove through town and again tried to ply him with drink, he didn't want it. He was quiet for the next 20 minutes as we drove around the town looking at stuff, until eventually near the station he gasped «Garages?» I replied ok non-committally, and he seemed a bit pleased over this. He looked oddly at me when I missed the road but gasped and gripped the door grab when I took the side track up.

He seemed to pale in the street lights and looked tense as we drove up the rutted track. He still hadn't requested a toilet stop but the light sheen on his face from the sweat proved he was feeling the strain.

When we pulled out at the stop he seemed to breath a small sigh of relief, but was still tense. I was sure it had worked its way through, but he still hadn't admitted he had to piss, and I was sure he'd pee hard enough to put a horse to shame!

He must have had the equivalent of 3-4 pints of alcohol now coupled an extra 45 minutes to hold it. I knew he was feeling the pressure, and the beach drive hadn't helped. All that bouncing around over the stones then the cobbled side roads in the town. There was a reason he looked a little pale and sat still, with occasional hidden squeezes of his bulge, getting more frequent as his aching and desperately bloated bladder reluctantly contained the pressure. His sphincters must have been quite strong, but he was still dry. He hadn't said anything but by the way he squirmed and reclenched his buttocks I figured he was struggling to contain it. There weren't many places, actual public toilets, open for him to visit to relieve himself and these old «garages' were almost ideal. Abandoned, half were broken into and overgrown with weeds.

As soon as we pulled in and got out he stretched and looked around, then walked over to the nearest open garage. I waited and then followed quietly. I hid by a shadow so when he glanced around he didn't see me. He scooped up an old tin from the floor and put it on a small drawer just below waist height then feverishly worked on his flies. Finally he gasped and then relaxed. His buttocks had been squirming and clenching to hold it back in, and now they relaxed as his screaming bladder was about to be relieved.

I was close. My eyesight had adjusted and I could see the pale shadow of his cock hanging there. He had been breathing so fast that he hadn't heard me. I wasn't sure if his hold failed or he let it go as there was a strong spurt that started very quickly and was also quite noisy, I almost missed his quiet sigh of relief, it came out as almost a whimper! The torrent was strong already

I counted to 3 and then said «Wotcha doing!»

He had just broken the seal. I had already heard him let a short strong spurt into the can before he stopped the flow, he winced and he had a hand in front so I guessed he was using his iron grip to hold his cock closed.

«Need a piss!» he croaked, he looked around

«Can I have some peace?» he pleaded. This was probably the worst moment for him. He'd just let a little out and his bladder was screaming for relief and the only way he could hold it was with his hand. His grasp squeezed his cock to hold the pressure back but he was loosing, his face unable to hold the agony, desperation and relief so close yet so far

«You didn't say, I could of stopped on the beach!»

«Well? No?»

«Please!» he croaked, he swore, then whimpered «Can't�. Can't hold�» He was squirming, holding his cock and then I heard a burst of pee as it splattered in, then a gasp and more as the pain forced him to release his hold and his cock started to spew a strong stream into the tin. This time he didn't try to hold it back, his kidneys had probably been in overdrive since leaving the house and now he was stealing that moment as he had no choice.

He let out a agonized groan that tapered into one of relief as he stopped holding it back and it splattered noisily into the can, like he'd just opened a standpipe or something. I walked around to his side to watch, he tried to staunch the flow but it was going so strongly

«Nice tackle» I grinned, he blushed and looked up

«Wow» he sighed, his waterfall was indeed strong and forceful. The look on his face was relief, embarrassment and a bit of surprise

«You should have said, I could have stopped on the beach. You know I usually do there anyway»

«I thought you'd make me wait»

«I made you wait worse by you not telling me» he grinned and nodded, relaxing. Strongly watering the can that he couldn't hold back, although I guess he'd past the point of wanting to hold it in.

«So I take it the pint you had at the pub and the walk back had its effect on you?» he nodded,

«Two� Two pints!» He gasped, and added «I nearly went at home but�» he finally eased the last drops out and before he could move I slipped my cock out and started to add more to the can, he gasped at me then glancing down grinned back again

«Not seen yours before» he offered, then looked puzzled

«You're�. you're straining?!» I nodded

«Usually can't pee in public» I said

«Am I public?»

«You're someone else, but I've not been this afternoon. I was trying to force the pain in me to go pee» he smiled back

«So I wasn't the only desperate one?» I shook my head. As I peed I saw his fingers move across then wrap around my cock.

«It's� a bit small» he offered

«Same size as yours?» I asked

«Bit bigger, but not much�.»

«It is when its aroused» the boy blushed.

«Yeah» he gasped softly

«Yours is good enough to work as a hosepipe» he grinned at that

«Oh yeah!» he groaned, his flow still pumping out.
