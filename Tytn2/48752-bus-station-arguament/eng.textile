«C'mon driver! Hurry!»

«I can't stop where there isn't a stand you know» the driver replied, she was being pushed forwards by the others behind her and her hands clamped around the support bars by the doorframe and cab-door. Her stability was a bit off, as her legs were clamped together in what must be an obviously revealing stance of her attitude. The driver slowly drove around the U shaped loading area, all the stands were full. The one he aimed for had also just been filled by another bus in front of them. They came to the end of the first U and moved back out in to the carriageway for a short distance before turning left into the second U.

These stands were all full as well, and she thought she'd really left it too late this time, but finally as they neared the last stand - before the driver would have to do another circuit - a bus pulled away and the packed double decker from the college pulled in. As soon as it came to a halt, the doors swung open with a hiss and she stumbled out. It was cooler out than the bus but she didn't notice. She hammered against the silver disc to get the door to open and it slowly slid open to reveal more people waiting, she had to push through them to get out into the corridor. She heard voices asking if it was a particular service but she didn't care. She only had one thing on her mind.

She had had a «free' period this afternoon in college and so a bunch of her pals had wondered over to the new Students Union building attached to the university. They didn't know they weren't University students or any of the rules that they should abide by, but a few drinks won't hurt!

They'd had their cocktails of orangeade and vodka shorts, they looked like soft drinks but weren't. She only had 3 glasses before the time was up and she had to return back to class. Having already «been' before lunch she figured she was fine so had figured the «reminders' were what she had been told were «ghost warnings'. Basically even if she went to the loo little would come out and 10 minutes later she'd have the feelings again. But ignoring them went away.

After the free period it was a class on history and adding more to the topic of the Socialist Eastern European Empire, but that was ages away yet. She had so many more important things to worry about, like clothes shopping, those new shoes at Ricardo's in town and getting her new phone sorted. It wouldn't take long, so of course had ignored those «feelings' until she got on the college bus.

This was where she felt uncomfortable. Some of the other lads on the bus were sneering at her as she tried to sit still and figured that they all knew she had to go. In the 45 minute plodding bus trip to town she got more and more desperate.

So she ran through the bus station, she could see the toilets up ahead and, swearing softly to herself, noticed they were closed for cleaning. The disabled loo was being used and she noticed a short queue. Already her gut was aching badly, she knew these weren't any more «ghost' feelings but she really had to take a piss in the worst way!

Finally joining the queue, her knapsack banging against her lower back as she stopped moving, every thump sending a jolt through her achingly full bladder to the point she reached back and stopped it from moving. Legs clamped together, and gritting her teeth as there was a lad in front of her from her class. She was sure she'd seen him on the bus but didn't know how he'd got here before her. Glancing back she noticed the path she had followed was inside the bus station around the edge. If he had run across the bus lanes he might have made it. She nudged him in the back, he turned, he was grimacing too

«You gotta go too?» she asked, he nodded and gulped.

«I'm desperate too» she groaned, he shrugged his shoulders.

«Well, if you do knock back those cocktails» and briefly smiled.

«You� You were there?» he nodded.

«I was actually doing some work, unlike you. Giggling away with your mates, it was obvious you were from the college and not the Uni» she didn't like him much at this point, but had a purpose to chat to him. For twofold, one was to take her mind off her aching bladder, threatening to burst and embarrass her and secondly to get something from him. She squirmed a little, making sure her legs were as tight as they could be without looking too obvious, she didn't want to bend over as it would compress her down there and put even more pressure on her strained facilities.

«Hey, do you think� D'yu think we could swap places?» she tried to look bashful, if he was a real gentleman he'd do it and she'd be next for the single loo»

«And why would I want to do that?» he raised his eyebrows and looked aloof

«Because� Because I'm a girl, and you're a gentleman» she smiled sweetly. He paused for a moment to think about that then moved a little closer, he lowered his voice so just she could hear

«Really? So you don't think you're a Sauv� sophisticated woman who deserves to go in front just because of her sex?»

»What? What are you on about?» she felt confused

«Remember a few days ago in M&S in town? You spotted me upstairs near the changing area?»

«Um» she remembered something, but that was ages ago. So much happened, but she remembered it a little

«I probably looked paler than usual and flushed?»

«Oh yeah, I remember» she smiled at him, expecting to get in front, he was close enough now to be inside her «personal space' but he was calm and not threatening

«You pushed past me to make a bee-line for the toilets, next to the changing areas» she remembered, it was probably that cappuccino she'd had down with her pals early, they did so many lovely blends there it was difficult just to have one!

«So?»

«I was heading for the loo's too, some brat friend of yours had punched me in the stomach»

«Ahh» she remembered that, they'd been playing (despite being late teens) on a large mountain pile of jeans and her mate had landed on a few lads. He'd probably had something closer to his privates than stomach, which would explain it more

«I already had to go, and your mate made it worse» he growled. She heard a noise, running water inside the loo then the snick of the lock. Her moment, she knew, and was distracted and desperate. She failed to notice his hands, until she saw the flash of movement, and the powerful shockwave hit her. He'd flicked his fingers to her waist with a sharp movement, and knew exactly where her obviously extremely sensitive bladder was, her bloated aching and full bladder. Then he moved away, he was at the door when the first surge hit her, and the door closed behind him as she felt something that made her light-headed yet even more desperate, followed by the feeling of damp underwear. Her fingers shot down, pushing hard on her crotch to hold the surge back and tightened her legs even more, the whimper already starting through gritted teeth

As he stepped into the loo and snicked the lock over a small smile crossed his face, but he quickly got to task. He'd not gone during the day, the last time was just after the 2 hour bus to college this morning and so having whipped his tool out he was lovingly letting out a strong splattering column into the loo. The smile increased, the pain decreased, faded and yet he still peed. On and on it came out. He had trained himself well for the long bus rides he had to take. A drawback of living in the countryside!

On and on it flowed, the ache had soon gone but on he peed. He had to «fully' empty himself so he could manage the next section on the bus without ending up desperate again! He heard noises outside and a gentle tap on the door but just smiled to himself, then he heard something he didn't expect too. The lock turned, snicked open. He had trouble stopping, he couldn't just «stop' it took time, and this time it wouldn't, he saw something over his shoulder, an orange jacket of someone from the bus station, and what sounded like the start of an apology, then «Get out, get out of my way, move dammit move!» the girls voice snarled, before he was pushed out of the way.

By then he had finally managed to clamp off the flow and carefully flipped it away, she pushed him out of the way and dumped her bag on the ground, his was still around his shoulder. Her fingers fumbling around the thick white decorative belt, she was breathing fast and muttering under her breath. She faced him and snarled «bugger off' before releasing her belt and working on her jeans. On the inside of one leg down to a knee and around her crotch it was dark and wet, glistening and she looked quite livid. He backed away, smiling to himself and out the door, where the guard was

«Sorry sir, she insisted some kids had locked the door and run off, she even knocked on the door to prove it»

«I heard a quiet knock�»

«She said she didn't want to break her nails» and smiled «Anyway, sorry» they heard a yelp from her then «Bastard» she called out

«Did she mean you or me Sir?» the guard half smiled

«I think she meant me. I lifted the toilet seat�»

«And she forgot to put it down!» he smiled, replying.

He sauntered off to his bus stand to wait. He wasn't sure how he'd explain this one to his mates as they'd soon find out so he'd best pre-empt her!
